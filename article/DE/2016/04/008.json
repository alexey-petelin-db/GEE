    "body": " Dear Colleagues,\n\nJacques Brand, CEO for the Americas, has informed us of his decision to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue another opportunity.\n\nJacques joined Bankers Trust in 1990 and has been among those central to building our presence in the United States and beyond. Earlier in his career, he helped to grow our Corporate Finance franchises in the US and globally.\n\nIn addition to his work on behalf of our clients and the Bank, he has led by example in representing Deutsche Bank to the broader community, including as Chairman of the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, a trustee of the Jewish Museum and as Chairman of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies.\n\nWe will announce Jacques' successor in due course.\n\nWe are immensely grateful to Jacques for his many contributions to Deutsche Bank throughout the years. Please join us in wishing him well in his future endeavors.\n\n\nJohn       J\u00fcrgen",
