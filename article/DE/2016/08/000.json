    "title": "Deutsche Bank survey reveals fixed income investors poised to significantly increase allocations to China's domestic bond market",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank today released findings of a survey of fixed income investors representing an estimated US$ 14.5 trillion in global AUM and over US$ 5.1 trillion in fixed income AUM. Feedback was primarily provided by senior investment professionals from global asset management firms who are based in Asia. The aggregate share of survey respondents\u2019 Asian local currency bond portfolio allocated to onshore Renminbi (RMB) bonds is seen increasing from roughly 5% at present to almost 13% a year from now, rising further to over 26% in five years\u2019 time.\n\nWith respect to the nascent Panda bond market (onshore Renminbi bonds issued by non-Chinese entities) in particular, nearly half of respondents indicated they may invest within the next 12 months, with a further 38% expecting to invest in 1-3 years\u2019 time.\n\nAt the end of August, the amount of outstanding bonds in China\u2019s domestic RMB bond market stood at RMB60.2 trillion according to Deutsche Bank research, with the interbank bond market (CIBM) representing more than 90% of the total market. Deutsche Bank research estimates that foreign investors\u2019 share of domestic interbank holdings was about 1.52% in August.\n\nDeutsche Bank Asia Pacific Head of Global Markets Michael Ormaechea reflected on the survey results, \u201cWe have been keenly focused on this market and the tremendous opportunity it represents due to its sheer scale and the diversification benefit it offers global investors. Investor interest and readiness to allocate to onshore RMB bonds as borne out by the survey has exceeded our own expectations. Now that access has opened up substantially for offshore investors, we expect foreign participation in China\u2019s domestic bond market to accelerate and for onshore Renminbi bonds to be an increasingly important component of major global fixed income investors\u2019 portfolios.\u201d\n\nThe challenge: investors most frequently cited in limiting investment in onshore RMB flagged that the absence of onshore RMB bonds from major indices as a limitation, but 82% expect inclusion in a major emerging market fixed income index to happen within the next two years.\n\nOver half of survey respondents indicated that the shift to a registration-based, quota-free system for CIBM market access had brought forward their institution\u2019s timeline for increasing investment in the market.\n\nFeng Gao, Deutsche Bank Chief Country Officer for China remarked, \u201cThe opening of China\u2019s domestic bond market has been a watershed moment for Renminbi internationalization. Adoption of the Renminbi as a currency for trade has been well established; freer access for global investors to such an enormous pool of investable assets is key in unlocking the potential of the Renminbi as a currency for investment as well.\u201d\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nDeutsche Bank AG\nPress & Media Relations\n\nAmy Chang\nPhone: +852 2203 8434\nE-mail: amy.chang@db.com\n\nGrace Zhang\nPhone : +86 10 5969 8617\nE-mail : grace.zhang@db.com\n\n\nAbout Deutsche Bank\n\nDeutsche Bank provides commercial and investment banking, retail banking, transaction banking and asset and wealth management products and services to corporations, governments, institutional investors, small and medium-sized businesses, and private individuals.
