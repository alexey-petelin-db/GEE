    "body": "Deutsche Bank today announced that it has successfully executed its first cross-border Renminbi netting transaction for Bosch under People's Bank of China (PBOC)\u2019s centralised cross-border Renminbi management by multinational companies scheme.\nHeadquartered in Germany, Bosch is a leading global supplier of technology and services. The company\u2019s operations consist of four business sectors \u2013 Mobility Solutions, Industrial Technology, Consumer Goods, as well as Energy and Building Technology.\nThe Bosch Group has a global netting centre in Germany for cross-border settlement transactions among intra-group companies. As part of the solution, Deutsche Bank has implemented a customised process to consolidate the RMB cross-border transactions of Bosch\u2019s China entities and settle with Bosch\u2019s global netting centre on a pre-defined netting schedule.\nComment\nChristian Zeidler, Head of Corporate Finance and Regional Treasury for APAC at Bosch, said: \u201cThis Renminbi netting solution will significantly benefit our global treasury operations with improved transaction costs due to the reduced number of payments, better global liquidity management across the group, and minimised onshore FX exposure by centralizing FX management in HQ Germany. Our China subsidiaries are now another step closer to full integration in our global treasury operations.\u201d\nMahesh Kini, Managing Director, Head of Trade Finance & Cash Management Corporates \u2013 China at Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have implemented this solution for the Bosch Group. Through the first netting transaction executed, Deutsche Bank was able to consolidate approximately 2000 cross-border payments into a single transaction, and save considerable costs and efforts to Bosch entities in China. This solution demonstrates our ability to offer a full suite of RMB cross-border solutions and is also another milestone in our efforts to bring innovative solutions to our key global clients operating in China.\u201d\n\nSuman Chaki, Managing Director, Head of Cash Management Corporates \u2013 Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cThis is a great achievement for Deutsche Bank. This successful transaction demonstrates our ability to implement customised solutions for our corporate clients to meet their cross-border transaction needs, especially in a key market like China.\u201d\nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides commercial and investment banking, retail banking, transaction banking and asset and wealth management products and services to corporations, governments, institutional investors, small and medium-sized businesses, and private individuals.
