    "body": "USC is a digital cash model aimed at facilitating payment and settlement for institutional financial markets. The group will collectively build on the successful outcome of initial explorations of the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) concept, performed by UBS and Clearmatics.\nThe focus of the work will consist of financial structuring of the USC and wider market structure implications; as well as market integration points for a fully operational utility settlement coin for future use by institutions. Additionally, Clearmatics is tasked with delivering early releases of the technology platform to underpin the concept. Active dialogue with central banks and regulators will continue to ensure a regulation compliant, robust and efficient structure within which the USC can be deployed.\n\"Digital cash is a core component of a future financial market fabric based on blockchain technologies,\" said Hyder Jaffrey, Head of Strategic Investment & FinTech Innovation at UBS Investment Bank. \"There are several digital cash models being explored across the Street. The Utility Settlement Coin is focussed on facilitating a new model for digital central bank cash.\"\nThe USC concept will be developed through a series of short iterative phases and platform deployments. At each stage the aim is to increase the number of market participants, broadening engagement, connectivity and network effect.\nCash is a leg to almost every trade, so this project is key to unlocking the benefits that the industry can gain from distributed automation technology in clearing, settlement and collateral management.\nRobert Sams, Founder and CEO of Clearmatics Technologies LTD.\n\u201cWe believe digital cash will be integral to next generation market infrastructure and will deliver significant benefits to our clients.\" said Michael McFadgen, Managing Director, Euclid Opportunities.\n\"As today's settlement and clearing is a process involving many institutions, it's vital that we collaborate with our peers to develop viable alternatives to current models, creating new digital capabilities for the financial services industry.\", added Paul Maley, Managing Director, Institutional Client Group, Deutsche Bank.\n\"Recent discussion of digital currencies by central banks and regulators has confirmed their potential significance. The USC is an essential step towards a future financial market on distributed ledger technologies,\" commented Julio Faura, Head of R&D at Santander.\n\u201cThe USC initiative provides an exciting opportunity to work closely with other industry thought leaders and the regulatory community to explore the possibilities of this technology.\u201d said Saket Sharma, Head of Treasury Services Technology at BNY Mellon.\nAbout Utility Settlement Coin (USC) concept\nUSC is an asset-backed digital cash instrument implemented on distributed ledger technology for use within global institutional financial markets. USC is a series of cash assets, with a version for each of the major currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, etc.) and USC is convertible at parity with a bank deposit in the corresponding currency. USC is fully backed by cash assets held at a central bank. Spending a USC will be spending its paired real-world currency.\nUBS and Clearmatics launched the concept in September 2015 to validate the potential benefits of USC for capital efficiency, settlement and systemic risk reduction in global financial markets. The project was initially incubated as part of the UBS Crypto 2.0 Pathfinder Program, UBS's initiative for research and experimentation on blockchain.\nThe successful conclusion of this first phase paved the way for the introduction of additional partners: BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, ICAP and Santander now join UBS and Clearmatics.\nAbout BNY Mellon\nBNY Mellon is a global investments company dedicated to helping its clients manage and service their financial assets throughout the investment lifecycle.
