    "body": "\u201cThese days, breaks and leaps are part of every career story. Of course, skills that have already been acquired are still important but lifelong learning is also essential,\u201d says Anna Katharina Herrhausen, the new Executive Director of the Alfred Herrhausen Foundation.\nShe is one of the \u201c40 under 40\u201d that Capital magazine has, for the ninth time since 2007, selected across German business, politics and society as part of its \u201cYoung Elite\u201d project. The categories included entrepreneurs, managers, politics and state and society.\nThis year\u2019s theme is: \u201cThe future of work \u2013 how our jobs are changing.\u201d The criteria included what drives these talented young people, what goals they have, and above all, what we can learn from their careers about the future of work.\nThe cover story of the current issue of Capital is titled \u201cDie Aufmischer\u201d - \u201cThe Agitators\u201d - and profiles six of the \u201c40 under 40,\u201d including Herrhausen.\nTwo other Deutsche Bank employees were also among the \u201c40 under 40\u201d: Eberhard Jakobi from Human Resources and Henning Potstada, a fund manager at DWS.",
