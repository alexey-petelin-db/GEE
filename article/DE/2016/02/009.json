    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) today published its 2015 Annual Report. Besides an overview of Deutsche Bank Group the Report contains the Management Report and the Bank\u2019s audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year 2015. In addition, the Bank published its 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report and Human Resources Report.\nJohn Cryan and J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, Co-Chief Executive Officers, wrote in their letter to shareholders: \u201c2015 was a challenging year for Deutsche Bank. We announced a new strategy which charts our course for the next five years, and embarked decisively on implementing it. Deutsche Bank recorded business growth last year.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cThe beginning of 2016 has seen volatility in the world\u2019s financial markets. This has impacted the banking sector. The seasonally strong first quarter might turn out to be challenging for the sector overall. Deutsche Bank is no exception to this. Nonetheless, in this period of market turbulence, Deutsche Bank remains very solid.\u201d\nAnnual Report\nThe 2015 Annual Report details the Bank\u2019s full-year audited financial results. Consistent with preliminary unaudited results published on January 28, 2016, the Bank reported a net loss for 2015 of 6.8 billion euros. In 2014 net income was 1.7 billion euros. Revenues were 33.5 billion euros, up 5 percent versus the prior year.\nCompensation\nTotal compensation increased slightly to 10.5 billion euros in 2015 (2014: 10.0 billion euros). This development partly reflects foreign exchange rate movements, together with a rise in the number of full-time equivalent staff to 101,104, up by approximately 3,000 versus the end of 2014.\nThis increase was driven in part by the internalization of external staff in key infrastructure areas, strategic hiring for growth in specific businesses, and the strengthening of the Bank\u2019s control functions: Compliance, Legal, and Audit.\nNonetheless, variable compensation was 2.4 billion euros in 2015, a decrease of 17 percent versus 2014 at constant exchange rates. In Corporate Banking & Securities, variable compensation decreased by 20 percent at constant exchange rates.\nThe Supervisory Board decided to reduce variable compensation for all Management Board members in office during the 2015 financial year to zero.\nThe members of the Management Board collectively received compensation of 22.7 million euros for 2015, a decrease of 36 percent versus 2014. Compensation for the Co-Chairmen of the Management Board, J\u00fcrgen Fitschen and John Cryan, who joined the Management Board as Co-Chief Executive Officer on July 1, 2015, was 3.8 million euros and 1.9 million euros respectively.\nHuman Resources\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s percentage of women at Managing Director and Director level rose again in 2015, from 19.4 percent to 20.5 percent, in line with the Bank\u2019s 2011 voluntary commitment which was also made by other DAX 30 companies. The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board was 35 percent. Sylvie Matherat, Chief Regulatory Officer, was appointed to the Management Board in November 2015. The Bank is committed to increasing gender diversity and creating equal opportunities for women, both across its organization and in positions of senior responsibility.\nDeutsche Bank employed staff of 149 different nationalities at the end of 2015.\nThe Human Resources Report provides transparency on Deutsche Bank\u2019s other key employee metrics. Investment in training and development increased by 12 percent during 2015. More than one third of open positions globally, and 60 percent of those in Germany, were filled internally in 2015. The Bank increased its investment in young talent during the year, hiring 766 university graduates globally, up by 33 percent versus 2014, and 863 new trainees for its apprenticeship programs in Germany, up by 5 percent over the previous year.\nCorporate Responsibility\nDeutsche Bank supports projects that empower the next generation to gain access to education and career opportunities. In 2015, the Bank widened its Born to Be youth engagement program to reach 1.3 million people (2014: 1.2 million). More than 17,000 employees of Deutsche Bank invested more than 185,000 hours of their time in Corporate Volunteering initiatives.\nDeutsche Bank further expanded its due diligence of the potential social and environmental impact of new business opportunities in 2015. During the year, the Bank conducted this due diligence on 1,346 potential transactions and customer relationships (2014: 1,250).\nDeutsche Bank has operated on a \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 basis since 2012. The Bank supports renewable energy projects, providing 5 billion euros in project finance for renewable energy projects generating a total capacity of more than 3,400 megawatts as at the end of 2015. Furthermore, the Bank supported the issue of Green Bonds with a total volume of 4 billion euros. As part of its liquidity reserve investments, Deutsche Bank invested 800 million euros in Green Bonds.\nDeutsche Bank focuses on different dimensions of sustainability and aims to balance commercial success with environmental and social responsibility. The Bank\u2019s Corporate Responsibility Report outlines a range of initiatives the Bank has undertaken in this area during 2015. The Bank strengthened its control systems and takes account of environmental and social factors in its core business. The Report outlines the Bank\u2019s varied corporate citizenship agenda.\nThe Management Board is committed to doing everything in its power to ensure that its people identify with Deutsche Bank and once again speak of their employer with pride.\nAll reports can be downloaded from: www.db.com/ir/en/reports-and-events.htm  \nThe Annual Report on Form 20-F, which will be submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the course of today, will also be made available following submission (in English only) on the website:\nhttps://www.db.com/ir/en/sec-filings-for-financial-results.htm\nAn updated 4Q2015 Financial Data Supplement is available at: www.db.com/15",
