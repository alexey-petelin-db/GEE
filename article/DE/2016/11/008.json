    "title": "Standard & Poor\u2019s announces CreditWatch for German banks",
    "body": "Standard & Poor's (S&P) has placed German banks on \u2018Creditwatch\u2019 to reflect the German Bank Resolution Regime, or \u2018bail-in\u2019 law, which was passed last year and takes effect on 1 January 2017.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s long-term issuer credit rating is placed on \u2018Creditwatch positive\u2019 (possible upgrade):\n\u2013   Reflects the increase in loss-absorbing buffers as a result of the bail-in law.\n\u2013   Strengthens Deutsche Bank\u2019s creditworthiness with the vast majority of customers.\n\u2013   Deutsche Bank\u2019s current rating: BBB+.\n\u2013   Senior instruments not subject to bail-in would likely move in line with the long-term issuer rating.\nThe long-term issuer credit rating represents S&P\u2019s forward-looking opinion of overall creditworthiness and capacity to meet financial commitments:\n\u2013   The new bail-in law strengthens the position of depositors and virtually all counterparties.\n\u2013   S&P is the only major rating agency which has not yet introduced depositor and counterparty ratings, but intends to do so next year.\nSenior unsecured debt of German banks is placed on Creditwatch developing (possible downgrade):\n\u2013   Under the \u2018bail-in\u2019 law, senior unsecured debt is subject to bail-in.\n\u2013   Deutsche Bank\u2019s current rating: BBB+.\n\u2013   Deutsche Bank\u2019s plain-vanilla senior instruments would likely be treated as senior subordinated debt, with a rating of BBB-.\n\u2013   This is not a Deutsche Bank-specific issue: it affects all German banks under the new legislation.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s ratings in both categories would remain investment grade if the Creditwatch were implemented.\nShort-term ratings remain unchanged at P-2.\nAll ratings remain at current levels at this point: the \u2018Creditwatch\u2019 will likely be resolved in the 1st quarter 2017.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s position has never been stronger than today:\n\n\u2013   Depositors and counterparties are protected under the \u2018bail-in\u2019 law by a buffer of EUR 111 billion in total loss absorbing capacity or \u2018TLAC\u2019, approximately EUR 30 billion ahead of its 2019 requirement.\n\n\u2013   Liquidity reserves are around EUR 200 billion, and have more than tripled in the post-crisis period.\n\n\u2013   Shareholders\u2019 equity is EUR 62 billion, and has almost doubled in the post-crisis period.\n\n\u2013   Both credit loss provisions and market risk (VaR) are at historically low levels.\n\n\u2013   Level 3 assets are down over 70% in the post-crisis period and non-core assets down over 90% since the formation of the Non-Core Operating Unit (NCOU).\n\n\u2013   Deutsche Bank has a funding base of over EUR 900 billion, of which over 70% from the most stable sources, and the 2016 funding plan is complete.",
