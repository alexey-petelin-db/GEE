    "title": "Deutsche Bank Presents \"Artist of the Year\" 2016",
    "body": "Starting April 29, Deutsche Bank is presenting the first institutional solo exhibition devoted to Basim Magdy, its \u201cArtist of the Year\u201d 2016. While the artist, who was born in 1977 in Assiut, Egypt, and now lives in Basel and Cairo, invites visitors to take a journey into the future, he is primarily concerned with the present. In the show at the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle, his slide projections, photographs, works on paper, and installations from 2006 to 2016 combine into a stream of images that reflects the fluid boundaries between reality and virtuality.\nThe title of the exhibition, \u201cThe Stars Were Aligned for a Century of New Beginnings,\u201d initially sounds optimistic. However, Basim Magdy plays ironically and humorously with the constantly changing cycle of hopes, utopias, and defeats. \u201cCollective Failure,\u201d says the artist, \u201chas the same relevance as it did in the nineteenth century and as it will in the twenty-second. There is nothing special about our time or what we're witnessing today. We are just naive enough to reenact the same mistakes that were made so many times before.\u201d\nIn addition to Basim Magdy\u2019s significant film trilogy from 2014, his large-scale 64-part photographic work \u201cAn Apology of a Love Story that Crashed into a Whale\u201d is at the center of the exhibition. Commissioned for the show, the work impressively illustrates Magdy\u2019s handling of photography and text.\nIn recent years, Basim Magdy has participated in numerous international group exhibitions, including the Sharjah and Istanbul biennials in 2013 and the Montreal and Biennale MEDIACITY Seoul biennials in 2014. His work was on view at the highly acclaimed exhibitions \u201cSurround Audience: New Museum Triennial 2015\u201d and \u201cOcean of Images. New Photography 2015\u201d at MoMA in New York.\nOwn part of the action\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue titled \u201cBasim Magdy: Would a Firefly Fear the Fire that Burns in Its Heart? Artist of the Year 2016,\u201d published by Hatje Cantz, with contributions by Regine Basha, Lauren Cornell, Britta F\u00e4rber, Friedhelm H\u00fctte, and Omar Kholeif (German/English, \u20ac 35).\nBasim Magdy developed \u201cThe Romantic Transformation of Loneliness into a Trade\u201d for the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle. The light box with six transparencies was created in an edition of 50 + 10 A.P. and can be purchased for \u20ac 900.\nThe exhibition \u201cBasim Magdy. The Stars Were Aligned for a Century of New Beginnings\u201d is on view from April 29 to July 3, 2016 at the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle in Berlin. Subsequently the show travels to Rome (MAXXI, National Museum of the 21st Arts) and Chicago (Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago).\nPress photos on the exhibition can be found at: http://www.photo-files.de/deutschebankkunsthalle\nArt, Culture & Sports\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s commitment to art is reflected by the bank\u2019s new Art, Culture & Sport department. The new unit bundles the bank\u2019s support programs and develops them further in conceptual terms. Together with its divisions, Deutsche wants to provide its customers with new access to the art, culture, and sports worlds.\nWith its involvement in contemporary art Deutsche Bank is setting standards worldwide, be it with the Deutsche Bank Collection, one of the world\u2019s most important collections of contemporary artworks on paper and photography, with international exhibitions, or with the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle in Berlin. And for many years the bank has had a presence at selected art fairs such as Frieze London, Frieze New York, Art Cologne and the Tokyo Art Fair.\nInformation on Deutsche Bank\u2019s global art program can be found at http://www.deutsche-bank.de/kunst and http://www.db-artmag.de.",
