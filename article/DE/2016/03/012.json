    "body": "Dear Colleagues,\nAfter consulting his doctors, Quintin Price, Head of Deutsche Asset Management, informed us on Friday that he will require a period of medical leave.\nQuintin\u2019s treatment plan is still being finalized, but it will necessitate his full-time focus for the foreseeable future as he undergoes further tests and consultations.\nQuintin has built a strong executive committee comprised of colleagues with many years of experience in serving clients and operating our Asset Management business. During Quintin\u2019s absence, Jon Eilbeck, Global Chief Operating Officer and Regional Head for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Asset Management, will cover Quintin\u2019s operational responsibilities, and I will represent Asset Management on the Management Board in accordance with the Bank\u2019s business allocation plan.\nQuintin has asked me to convey his gratitude to all of you for the support he has received recently. Please join me in wishing Quintin well as he begins his treatment plan.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Cryan",
