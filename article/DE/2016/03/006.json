    "body": "In his work, Basim Magdy presents an unbiased view of reality. He is primarily interested in the present, but his art is like a psychedelic journey.\nThe combination of text and pictures is characteristic for his works and their absurdity provides a more unbiased and individual perspective on reality.\nIn the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle Berlin, visitors can expect to see a collection of brightly coloured works on paper, a film trilogy from 2014 and a 64-piece large-sized photographic work which has been specially produced for this exhibition.\nThe exhibition \u201cThe Stars Were Aligned for a Century of New Beginnings\u201dcan be seen at the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle in Berlin until July 3, 2016.\n \nPhoto: Deirdre O'Leary, \u00a9 Basim Magdy",
