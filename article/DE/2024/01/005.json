    "title": "Helping XTransfer execute its first onshore Thai Baht trade",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank helped Shanghai-based XTransfer become the first foreign payment service provider in Thailand to execute an onshore Thai Baht (THB) trade, under the Bank of Thailand\u2019s latest Non-Resident Qualified Company (NRQC) rules. By doing this, XTransfer is now able to offer a smooth cross-border payments service to its own clients who export goods to Thailand.\nHow it works\nDeutsche Bank helped XTransfer (as a non-Thai company) obtain NQRC status which allows XTransfer to receive local payments from Thai buyers on behalf of export companies. Deutsche Bank then converts THB payments to Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi and transfers the funds to XTransfer\u2019s offshore accounts, for onward payment to the export clients. \nKey benefits of having NRQC status include a higher THB limit for accounts (more than THB 200 million) and shorter FX settlement times.\n\u201cWe are committed to helping our clients maximise the opportunity in Thailand and facilitating the ease of doing business here,\u201d said Pimolpa Simaroj, Chief Country Officer for Thailand.\nWe hope this landmark first will pave the way for more China and internationally based companies to expand their operations and grow in the Thai market.\nPimolpa Simaroj\nIn 2023, Deutsche Bank Thailand was named Asiamoney\u2019s \u2018Best Corporate Bank\u2019. It was also recognized by the Asset for \u2018Best Payments and Collections Solution\u2019 and \u2018Best Structured Trade Finance Solution.\u2019",
