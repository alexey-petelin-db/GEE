    "body": "It\u2019s that time of year when our thematic research team looks at what topics could move markets in the coming year. These are obviously not set in stone \u2013 from the top ten topics last year, six turned out to be fairly accurate, two didn\u2019t and two remain to be seen. So what might 2023 bring? The report takes a look at developments in the economy, business and politics that could impact markets, as well as topics that are growing in importance. Read about Fed decisions and Covid policies in China; general elections \u2013 or a lack thereof; supply chains and trade. Or you might be interested in hearing about the supply of semiconductors; the importance of tech and the threat of cybercrime. Whether you agree or disagree with the team\u2019s ideas, we hope they will at least provoke an interesting discussion about the direction of markets, the economy, business and politics next year.\nRead the full report from Luke Templeman, Henry Allen, Marion Laboure, Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace, Galina Pozdnyakova, Adrian Cox and Olga Cotaga or explore each chapter as they appear on the Deutsche Bank Research LinkedIn channel over the coming weeks.\n ",
