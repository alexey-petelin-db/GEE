The landmark programme allowed PPC to extract 325 million euros funding against its stock of unpaid electricity bills and strengthen its liquidity position. Deutsche Bank, which has a longstanding relationship of more than 15 years with PPC, acted as sole arranger and provided part of the financing.\nAwards were judged as a result of a comprehensive process of market research including an online poll and pitches.\nNikunj Gupta, Head of European CLO New Issue, said: \u201cDeutsche Bank is one of the leading arranging banks for European CLOs and these awards are a testament to Deutsche Bank\u2019s strength in originating, structuring and syndicating European CLOs.\nNorth Westerly 7 is one of the few ESG CLOs issued to date and we continue to explore more ESG securitisation transactions, leveraging off Deutsche Bank\u2019s strengths in the space.\u201d\nMauricio Suarez Rodriguez, Co-head of European Global Financing and Credit Trading Structuring, said: \u201cWe are proud of this recognition following a standout year for the ABS franchise. Deutsche Bank differentiated itself from the competition by bringing to market transactions across 10 jurisdictions over the course of the year (and CLO collateral across a further eight), offering our clients a full suite of solutions to address their needs in terms of funding, capital and non-performing asset disposals.\u201d",
