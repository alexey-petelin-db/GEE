    "body": "Deutsche Bank today announced the appointment of Richard Stewart as Group Treasurer with effect from Monday, September 19. Stewart will also continue in his current role as Head of the Capital Release Unit. He will report to James von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, in his capacity as Group Treasurer while continuing to report to Rebecca Short, Chief Transformation Officer, in his role as Head of the Capital Release Unit.\n\u201cRichard is highly qualified to succeed in his new role, given his experience and achievements in capital and balance sheet management,\u201d James von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, said. \u201dHe has contributed significantly to the success of Deutsche Bank\u2019s transformation. Under Richard\u2019s leadership, the Capital Release Unit continued to reduce leverage exposure and risk weighted assets, freeing up capital from non-strategic activities, while simultaneously delivering substantial cost reductions.\u201d\nRichard Stewart said: \u201cI am privileged to have this opportunity to lead Group Treasury. I look forward to helping the team to build on its successes of the past few years. Treasury has played a vital role in supporting Deutsche Bank\u2019s transformation agenda, delivering capital and balance sheet strength, achieving significant improvements in resource efficiency and cost of funding as well as completing a string of successful capital market issuances. This gives us a strong platform for the future.\u201d\nStewart joined Deutsche Bank in 2006 and was appointed Head of the Capital Release Unit in June 2021. Prior to this he held several senior roles in Market & Valuation Risk Management. His Deutsche Bank experience also includes eight years in Strategic Corporate Lending, where he was Head of Portfolio Risk.",
