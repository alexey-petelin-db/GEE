Slyngstad would succeed Gerhard Eschelbeck, who will not stand for re-election when his five-year term ends at this year\u2019s AGM.  \nSlyngstad was CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the entity managing the world\u00b4s largest sovereign wealth fund in Norway, for 13 years. Prior to that he led the fund\u2019s equity management organisation since its establishment in 1998. Earlier this month he joined Aker ASA, a Norwegian investment company, to oversee its newly created asset management division. The organization will be focused primarily on investments related to energy transition necessitated by climate change. Slyngstad holds degrees in economics, law, political sciences and philosophy from universities in Oslo and Paris, and the University of California.  \n\n\u201cWe very much look forward to Yngve Slyngstad joining the Supervisory Board,\u201d said Mayree Clark, Chair of the Supervisory Board\u2019s Nomination Committee. \u201cWe will benefit from his network in the global financial industry and his vast experience as one of the pioneers of sustainable investing, as well as his current focus on cutting edge matters related to climate change and energy transition.\u201d  \n\nPaul Achleitner, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, added: \u201cWe are delighted to be able to nominate Yngve Slyngstad, in line with our longstanding approach to bring together highly capable individuals in a diverse Supervisory Board which brings expertise and judgement for the benefit of the bank.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI greatly appreciate the Supervisory Board\u2019s nomination,\u201d Slyngstad said. \u201cDeutsche Bank plays a crucial role in the development of Europe\u2019s financial industry and will play an important role in the financing of the transition to a sustainable and carbon-neutral economy. Subject to the vote at the AGM, I would be delighted to contribute to the further development of Deutsche Bank\u2019s strategy.\u201d  \n\nAchleitner thanked Gerhard Eschelbeck, Chief Information Security Officer at Aurora Innovation, Inc., who joined Deutsche Bank\u2019s Supervisory Board in 2017: \u201cGerhard Eschelbeck has been a highly esteemed member of our Supervisory Board and made important contributions, in particular with his experience and expertise in technology. We thank him for his excellent work and wish him well in his new endeavours.\u201d",
