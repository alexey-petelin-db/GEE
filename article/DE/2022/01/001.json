    "body": "Introduced last November at COP26, the philanthropic fund is the first of its kind set up by a financial institution, giving donors the opportunity to support Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for ocean conservation efforts through a dedicated international framework to facilitate donations.\nAccording to a research report from Deutsche Bank\u2019s CIO Office called Coastlines in Crisis, coastal resilience measures to counter climate change will require significant investment, estimated to be up to 500 billion US dollars by 2050.\nDeutsche Bank Global Head of the International Private Bank and CEO for Europe, the Middle East and Africa Claudio de Sanctis said: \u201cWe are committed to supporting ocean conservation and a sustainable blue economy. With the establishment of our Ocean Resilience Philanthropy Fund, we are excited to give clients the opportunity to help secure a better, more sustainable future for one of the world\u2019s most precious resources, our oceans.\u201d\nThe Deutsche Bank Ocean Resilience Philanthropy Fund will focus on advancing NbS to support ocean conservation and restoration initiatives. The Fund\u2019s first initiative is the Future Climate Coral Bank, a research project in the Maldives led by the Maldives Coral Institute that aims to identify coral species that are resilient to climate change and conserve them in a living gene bank.\nAn estimated \nPDF\n50 per cent of coral reefs have been destroyed by human activity and scientists predict a 1.5 degree temperature rise threatens up to 90 per cent of the world\u2019s reefs by 2050, due to heatwaves. The coral gene bank project in the Maldives will help the nation of islands to monitor and repair its reefs naturally, and ultimately help scientists to heal and strengthen coral reefs around the world.\nIPB Head of Wealth Planning and Philanthropy, Jacqueline Valouch said: \u201cThe Fund provides a philanthropy framework for directing much needed capital to projects that support ocean restoration and resilience globally, helping to protect ocean habitats for future generations.\u201d\nThe bank has committed an initial 300,000 US dollars to launch the Fund and aims to raise up to 5 million US dollars within five years.\nAdministered by the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF), the Fund is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF), which is a charitable fund that allows an entity or individual to make irrevocable gifts that can then be distributed to charitable causes they care about.\nDeutsche Bank is a founding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and was the first bank to join the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA) as a full member last year.\nClients interested in contributing to the Fund as part of a tailored philanthropy plan should contact our Head of Wealth Planning and Philanthropy, Jacqueline Valouch.
