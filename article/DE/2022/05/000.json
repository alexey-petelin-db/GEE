As a judge I saw how the winners have consistently demonstrated a commitment to driving change and tackling some of the biggest challenges facing our society.\n\"The creative industries remain one of the hardest hit from the pandemic yet these entrepreneurs today demonstrate the talent that is at the forefront of the UK\u2019s recovery. They have presented ideas and businesses that offer exciting new opportunities and ways to create a better future.\u201d\nCommenting on the winners Kevin Osborne added:\n\u201cThis has been one of the strongest selection of applicants I\u2019ve seen in the four years MeWe360 have been supporting DBACE. I\u2019m looking forward to working with each of the five winners throughout the year as we provide them invaluable hands-on support, networking and tailored mentor programmes alongside the significant financial investment.\n\"As a judge it is incredible to see each of the applicants and watch these amazing young creative entrepreneurs pitch to us each year. It is also incredible to see our winners develop throughout the year and grow sustainable businesses that will lead the UK\u2019s creative sectors.\u201d\nSince 1993, Deutsche Bank has through DBACE overseen the launch and growth of over 230 creative ventures, supporting the work of the business leaders of tomorrow and celebrating those on a mission to tackle some of today\u2019s most significant issues.
