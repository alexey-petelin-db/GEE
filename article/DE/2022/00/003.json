    "body": "On 27 January 2022, Deutsche Bank reported its results for the fiscal year 2021: highest full-year net profit since 2011, profit before tax was \u20ac 3.4 billion. During his speech at the Annual Media Conference, CEO Christian Sewing gave details on the numbers, the strategy and an outlook into the future. See his key messages in this video.\nIn 2021, we increased our net profit fourfold and delivered our best result in ten years while putting almost all of our expected transformation costs behind us. All four core businesses performed at or ahead of our plan, and our reduction of legacy assets progressed faster than expected. We are delighted to be resuming capital distributions to our shareholders as we promised in the summer of 2019. Our transformation progress and financial performance in 2021 provide a strong step-off point to achieve our target of a return on tangible equity of 8% in 2022.\nChristian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer\nResults for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021.\nPDF\nChristian Sewing speech\nPDF\nJames von Moltke speech\nPDF\nPresentation\nImage Gallery",
