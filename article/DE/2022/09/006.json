    "title": "Moody\u2019s further upgrades Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings",
    "body": "The rating agency Moody\u2019s today announced that it has upgraded all of Deutsche Bank\u2019s long-term ratings by one notch. Our long-term deposit ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings have both been upgraded from A2 to A1 with a stable outlook, their highest level since 2012, while our Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) is now at its highest since 2014.\nThis represents the fourth successive upgrade of Deutsche Bank by leading rating agencies, and the second upgrade by Moody\u2019s, in the past fourteen months. The agency sees Deutsche Bank as well placed to face the headwinds in the current environment.\n\u201cI am delighted that a key stakeholder has, once again, recognised Deutsche Bank\u2019s progress on the path of transformation,\u201d Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer, said. \u201cThanks to the outstanding efforts of our people, we have built a strong platform to help us steer our clients through more challenging conditions.\u201d\nJames von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, added: \u201cDisciplined execution of our strategy is paying off. Higher earnings power, strong risk management, sound capital and balance sheet quality have all contributed to this highly encouraging result.\u201d\nDrivers of this upgrade: Deutsche Bank\u2019s progress in meeting targets\u2026\nMoody\u2019s made clear that this upgrade reflected Deutsche Bank\u2019s \u201cprogress towards meeting its medium-term targets, in particular by being able to sustain improved \u2026 profitability.\u201d The agency added: \u201cMoody\u2019s expects that DB\u2019s meaningfully reduced expense base should allow the bank to safeguard operating leverage in times of temporarily higher inflation and, thereby, defend its regained earnings strength.\u201d\n\u2026 and well positioned in a challenging environment\nMoody\u2019s saw Deutsche Bank\u2019s business model as well placed to face a more challenging macro-economic environment. The agency continued: \u201cFurther, recent interest-rate hikes have improved the prospects for higher returns within the bank\u2019s core lending businesses conducted in its retail and corporate banking segments despite expectations of at least a normalization in the cost of risk.\u201d\nKey factors: high quality funding and strong risk management\u2026\nMoody\u2019s mentioned other factors as key drivers of this upgrade, including Deutsche Bank\u2019s \u201chigh quality deposit base as well as \u2026 the bank\u2019s prudent and well controlled risk appetite that is likely to result in a sound and relatively stable asset quality through the cycle.\u201d The agency noted: \u201cDB has reserved \u20ac 5.0 billion in allowances for potential loan losses \u2026 this buffer will help dampen the impact on profitability and capital that may arise from a sharper-than-anticipated deterioration in asset quality.\u201d\n\u2026 and robust capital and balance sheet management\nMoody\u2019s added: \u201cFurther, DB has maintained solid capital and liquidity metrics, additionally supporting its improved credit profile.\u201d\n  Deutsche Bank\u2019s principal ratings with leading rating agencies are now as follows:",
