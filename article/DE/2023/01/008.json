In 2022, we demonstrated this by delivering our best results for fifteen years. Thanks to disciplined execution of our strategy, we have been able to support our clients through highly challenging conditions, proving our resilience with strong risk discipline and sound capital management. As a result, we are well-equipped to deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders in the years ahead.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today announced its highest annual profit, both before and after tax, since 2007.\nProfit before tax was \u20ac 5.6 billion in 2022, up 65% over 2021. This reflected 7% growth in net revenues with a 5% year-on-year reduction in noninterest expenses, resulting in a cost/income ratio of 75%, down from 85% in 2021.\nNet profit was \u20ac 5.7 billion in 2022, more than double the prior year. This includes a positive year-end deferred tax asset valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion, compared to \u20ac 274 million in the prior year, which reflected continued strong performance in the bank\u2019s US operations. Excluding the impact of this adjustment, the effective tax rate would have been 24% for 2022.\nPost-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity (RoTE)\u00b9 was 9.4%, up from 3.8% in 2021. Post-tax RoE\u00b9 was 8.4%, up from 3.4% in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share were \u20ac 2.37, up from \u20ac 0.93 in 2021, and management intends to recommend a dividend of \u20ac 0.30 per share for 2022, up from \u20ac 0.20 per share for 2021, to the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, profit before tax was \u20ac 775 million, up more than ninefold from \u20ac 82 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting 7% year-on-year growth in net revenues with a 7% year-on-year reduction in noninterest expenses. The quarter was positively impacted by a gain of approximately \u20ac 310 million on the sale of Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors in Italy. Net profit was \u20ac 2.0 billion, up from \u20ac 315 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, and reflects the aforementioned positive tax impact. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate would have been 29% for the quarter. Fourth-quarter post-tax RoTE\u00b9 was 13.1%, up from 1.1% in the prior year quarter, and post-tax RoE\u00b9 was 11.7%.\nHaving fulfilled its de-risking and cost reduction mandate from 2019 through end-2022, the Capital Release Unit will cease to be reported as a separate segment with effect from the first quarter of 2023. Its remaining portfolio, resources and employees will be reported within the Corporate & Other (C&O) segment.\n\u201cOur 2022 results demonstrate the benefits of Deutsche Bank\u2019s transformation efforts\u201d, said James von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer. \u201cWe have delivered revenue growth in our core businesses and continued cost reductions. Our risk provisions are in line with guidance despite challenging conditions during the year. Focused de-risking of our balance sheet has contributed to our solid capital ratio and the completion of the Capital Release Unit journey marks a major milestone in our transformation execution. All of this demonstrates good momentum on the path towards our 2025 objectives.\u201d\nCore Bank: profit before tax rises 37% to \u20ac 6.5 billion\nIn the Core Bank, which excludes the Capital Release Unit, profit before tax was \u20ac 6.5 billion, up 37% year on year and the highest since the Core Bank\u2019s formation in 2019. Profit growth was driven by 7% growth in net revenues to \u20ac 27.2 billion and a reduction in noninterest expenses of 3%, or 5% if adjusted for FX movements, despite an increase in bank levies of approximately \u20ac 200 million compared with 2021. Post-tax RoTE\u00b9 was 11.3% in 2022, up from 6.4% in 2021, in line with a target of above 9%. The Core Bank\u2019s cost/income ratio improved to 71%, from 79% in 2021.\nGrowth and diversification of Core Bank earnings\nThe contribution of core businesses to Core Bank profit before tax was as follows:\nCorporate Bank: \u20ac 2.1 billion, more than double the 2021 level of \u20ac 1.0 billion, with post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of 12.5% and a cost/income ratio of 62%\nInvestment Bank: \u20ac 3.5 billion, down 6%, with post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of 9.2% and a cost/income ratio of 62%\nPrivate Bank: \u20ac 2.0 billion, up by more than fivefold from \u20ac 355 million in 2021, with post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of 10.6% and a cost/income ratio of 72%\nAsset Management: \u20ac 598 million, down 27% year on year, with post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of 17.1% and a cost/income ratio of 70%\nIn the fourth quarter, Core Bank profit before tax was \u20ac 971 million, more than double the level of the fourth quarter of 2021. This development reflects a 7% rise in net revenues and a 4% reduction in noninterest expenses. The Core Bank\u2019s post-tax RoTE\u00b9 rose to 14.9%, from 3.4% in the prior year quarter, while the cost/income ratio was 79%, down from 88% in the prior year quarter.\nCapital Release Unit: capital accretion through de-risking and cost reduction\nThe Capital Release Unit delivered further de-risking and cost reduction in 2022. By year-end, leverage exposure was reduced to \u20ac 22 billion, down 43% from the end of 2021 and down 91% since the creation of the Capital Release Unit in mid-2019. Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) were \u20ac 24 billion, down by 13% year on year and by 63% since the Capital Release Unit\u2019s creation, or down 83% excluding Operational Risk RWA. As at year-end 2022, RWA of \u20ac 24 billion included \u20ac 19 billion of Operational Risk RWA.\nThe Capital Release Unit\u2019s loss before tax was \u20ac 932 million, a reduction of 32% from a loss of before tax \u20ac 1.4 billion in 2021. This improvement was predominantly driven by a 36% year-on-year reduction in noninterest expenses to \u20ac 922 million. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges\u00b9 were \u20ac 781 million, in line with guidance of approximately \u20ac 800 million, for 2022. The Capital Release Unit\u2019s full-year adjusted costs have been reduced by 77%, or approximately \u20ac 2.5 billion, from pre-transformation (2018) levels.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Capital Release Unit reported a loss before tax of \u20ac 197 million, down 44% from the prior year quarter. This improvement was largely driven by a 49% year-on-year reduction in noninterest expenses.\nThe net positive impact of the Capital Release Unit on Deutsche Bank\u2019s CET1 ratio was approximately 45 basis points from the beginning of 2019 to year-end 2022, as the cumulative benefit of RWA reduction exceeded the negative impact of the Capital Release Unit\u2019s losses over this period. The net positive impact of leverage exposure reduction by the Capital Release Unit over the same period also contributed approximately 55 basis points to Deutsche Bank\u2019s leverage ratio.\nNet revenues: significant progress in \u2018stable revenue\u2019 businesses in 2022\nNet revenues were \u20ac 27.2 billion in 2022, up 7% year on year, and \u20ac 6.3 billion, up 7%, in the fourth quarter. In both the full year and fourth quarter of 2022, revenues were the highest since 2016, despite business perimeter reductions as part of the bank\u2019s transformation launched in 2019. Revenue development in the core businesses was as follows:\nCorporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 6.3 billion in 2022, up 23% year on year, with 39% growth in net interest income and 7% growth in commission and fee income, driven by higher interest rates, strong operating performance, business growth and favorable FX movements. All business areas contributed to revenue growth, with Corporate Treasury Services up 24%, Institutional Client Services up 22% and Business Banking up 19%. Deposits grew by 7%, or \u20ac 18 billion, during the year while average loans gross of allowances were up 7%, or \u20ac 9 billion, in 2022. In the fourth quarter, net revenues were \u20ac 1.8 billion, the highest for any quarter since the creation of the Corporate Bank in 2019, and up 30% over the fourth quarter of 2021, with Corporate Treasury Services up 26%, Institutional Client Services up 28% and Business Banking up 51%.\nInvestment Bank net revenues were \u20ac 10.0 billion in 2022, up 4% over 2021. Revenues in Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) were \u20ac 8.9 billion, up 26% year on year and the highest for a decade. Revenues in Rates, Emerging Markets and Foreign Exchange were significantly higher due to heightened market activity, growth in client flows and disciplined risk management, while Financing revenues were higher, primarily driven by increased net interest income. This growth more than offset lower Credit Trading revenues which partly reflected the non-recurrence of a concentrated distressed position in 2021. Origination & Advisory Revenues were \u20ac 1.0 billion euros, down 62% year on year, reflecting lower industry fee pools and mark to market losses in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets, while Advisory revenues were essentially flat, outperforming a lower industry fee pool. Deutsche Bank returned to the no 1 ranking in German M&A (source: Dealogic). In the fourth quarter, net revenues were \u20ac 1.7 billion, down 12% year on year. FIC revenues grew 27% to \u20ac 1.5 billion, the highest fourth quarter for more than ten years. This was more than offset by a 71% year-on-year decline in Origination & Advisory revenues.\nPrivate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 9.2 billion, up 11% year on year. Revenues were up 6% if adjusted for specific items, predominantly the aforementioned gain on sale in Italy, and the reduced impact of forgone revenues relating to the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on pricing agreements in April 2021. Growth was driven by higher interest rates, FX movements and higher business volumes. New business volumes were \u20ac 41 billion in 2022 and comprised net inflows into assets under management, including deposits and investment products, of \u20ac 30 billion, and net new client loans of \u20ac 11 billion. Net revenues in the Private Bank Germany were \u20ac 5.3 billion, up 6% year on year, and by 4% if adjusted for the impact of the BGH ruling. Net revenues in the International Private Bank were \u20ac 3.8 billion, up 19% year on year, and up 9% if adjusted for the gain on sale in Italy and other specific items which consisted of Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. In the fourth quarter, Private Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.5 billion, up 23% over the fourth quarter of 2021, and up 10% if adjusted for specific items and the BGH ruling impact, while net inflows into assets under management were \u20ac 5 billion. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany were \u20ac 1.4 billion, up 7%, while revenues in the International Private Bank were \u20ac 1.2 billion, up 49% year on year, and up 10% if adjusted for the gain on sale in Italy and other specific items.\nAsset Management net revenues were \u20ac 2.6 billion, down 4% year on year. Management fees rose 4%, reflecting higher fees in Alternatives which were partly offset by negative market impacts on revenues from Active and Passive products. Growth in management fees and a positive impact from FX movements were more than offset by a significant year-on-year decline in performance fees, partly reflecting the non-recurrence of a large performance fee on a Multi-Asset fund recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Assets under management were \u20ac 821 billion at year-end 2022, down 11% from the end of the prior year, predominantly driven by market depreciation; net outflows of \u20ac 20 billion were more than offset by a positive FX impact of \u20ac 22 billion during the year. In the fourth quarter, net revenues were \u20ac 609 million, down 23% year on year, largely driven by significantly lower performance fees, reflecting the aforementioned non-recurrence of a large performance fee. Fourth-quarter assets under management declined by \u20ac 12 billion, including net outflows of \u20ac 2 billion.\nContinued reductions in noninterest expenses\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 20.4 billion, down 5% year on year. This partly reflected a significant decline in transformation charges as Deutsche Bank completed the transformation initiatives announced in 2019. This more than offset a year-on-year rise in bank levies of 38%, or approximately \u20ac 200 million. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies\u00b9 were \u20ac 19.0 billion, essentially flat compared to the prior year, and down 3% if adjusted for FX movements. A 3% rise in compensation and benefits expenses was offset by lower non-compensation expenses, including lower IT and professional services expenses, reflecting the bank\u2019s continued cost reduction efforts, with reductions in costs from outsourced operations and occupancy-related expenditure.\nWithin the transformation period, adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies\u00b9 have been reduced by more than \u20ac 3 billion compared to \u20ac 22.1 billion in 2018. This reflected a reduction of around \u20ac 1.0 billion in compensation and benefits due to changes in workforce size and composition; a reduction of around \u20ac 0.5 billion in IT spending, despite cumulative expenditure of around \u20ac 15 billion during transformation; a reduction of approximately \u20ac 0.5 billion in professional services costs; and a reduction of more than \u20ac 1.0 billion in other items including building costs, operational tax and insurance expenses, and travel and marketing expenses.\nIn the fourth quarter, noninterest expenses were \u20ac 5.2 billion, down 7% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Noninterest expenses in the quarter included an impairment of intangibles of \u20ac 68 million relating to a historic acquisition in Asset Management. Noninterest expenses also reflect settlements and other developments in certain litigation and regulatory enforcement matters, including ongoing regulatory discussions to resolve matters concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and embargoes and AML compliance, and remedial agreements and obligations related to risk management issues. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies\u00b9 were \u20ac 4.8 billion, down 2%, and down 4% if adjusted for FX movements. Compensation and benefits expenses were essentially stable year on year, although lower if adjusted for FX movements, while IT expenses, professional services and other expenses were all lower compared to the prior year quarter.\nThe workforce was 84,930 full-time equivalents (FTEs) at the end of 2022, up by 374 FTEs during the fourth quarter. This increase predominantly reflects continued internalization of external staff which added 455 FTEs in the quarter.\nCredit provisions remain contained in a more challenging credit environment\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.2 billion in 2022, up from \u20ac 515 million in 2021. The year-on-year development reflected more challenging macro-economic conditions during most of 2022 against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, while 2021 benefited from economic recovery following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Provisions were 25 basis points of average loans, in line with guidance provided in March 2022. Provision for non-performing loans (Stage 3) was \u20ac 1.0 billion, spread across regions and segments. Provision for performing loans (Stage 1 and 2) was \u20ac 204 million and was driven by deteriorating macro-economic forecasts through most of the year.\nIn the fourth quarter, provision for credit losses was \u20ac 351 million, up from \u20ac 254 million in the prior year quarter, comprising Stage 3 provisions of \u20ac 390 million and a net release of Stage 1 and 2 provisions of \u20ac 39 million. Provisions in the quarter benefited from the release of an overlay from previous periods and stabilizing macro-economic forecasts towards the end of the quarter. The year-on-year increase was driven by certain individual situations and did not reflect broader trends across the portfolio.\nSustained, significant reduction in Russia Exposure during 2022\nDeutsche Bank significantly reduced its Russian credit exposure during 2022. Gross loan exposure was reduced by 42% to \u20ac 806 million while net loan exposure was cut by 36% to \u20ac 379 million. Additional contingent risk was reduced by 90% to \u20ac 154 million. This comprised undrawn commitments of \u20ac 78 million, down from \u20ac 1.0 billion at the end of 2021 and largely mitigated by contractual drawdown protection and parental guarantees for multinational corporates, and guarantees of \u20ac 76 million, down 86% during 2022 after significant roll-offs during the year. Deutsche Bank remains committed to further exposure reductions.\nCapital, leverage and liquidity: in line with goals\nThe CET1 ratio was 13.4% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 13.3% at the end of the third quarter. This development reflected the positive capital impact of fourth-quarter earnings, largely offset by regulatory deductions for deferred tax assets, dividends and Additional Tier 1 (AT1) coupons. A small positive impact from FX movements was more than offset by the impact of RWA changes, primarily higher market risk RWA. The CET1 ratio has remained above the bank\u2019s target minimum of 12.5% since the launch of transformation in the second quarter of 2019.\nThe Leverage ratio was 4.6% in the fourth quarter, in line with the bank\u2019s target, and up from 4.3% in the third quarter. The quarter-on-quarter development reflected the positive impacts of FX movements, lower leverage exposure driven by seasonally lower trading activity, and the rise in Tier 1 capital driven by fourth-quarter earnings and an AT1 capital issuance in November, partly offset by the aforementioned regulatory deductions.\nLiquidity reserves were \u20ac 256 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, down slightly from \u20ac 262 billion at the end of the third quarter, including High Quality Liquid Assets of \u20ac 219 billion. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 142%, above the regulatory requirement of 100% and a surplus of \u20ac 64 billion. The Net Stable Funding Ratio was 119%, at the upper end of the bank\u2019s target range of 115-120% and implying a surplus of \u20ac 98 billion above required levels.\n2025 goals reaffirmed\nDeutsche Bank reaffirmed its financial targets and capital objectives for 2025. The bank aims for a post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of above 10%, compound annual revenue growth of between 3.5% and 4.5% from 2021, and a cost/income ratio of below 62.5%. The bank further aims for a CET1 ratio of around 13% in 2025, reaffirms its target for a payout ratio of 50% from 2025 onwards and aims for \u20ac 8 billion in capital distributions to shareholders in respect of the financial years 2021 through 2025.\nSustainable Finance: cumulative volumes ahead of target\nESG-related financing and investment volumes\u00b2 in the fourth quarter were \u20ac 18 billion. This brought the cumulative total since January 1, 2020, to \u20ac 215 billion for the Deutsche Bank Group ex-DWS, up from \u20ac 157 billion at the end of 2021. This exceeds the bank\u2019s year-end 2022 target for a cumulative total of \u20ac 200 billion, despite a challenging environment in 2022. Volumes in 2022 included a net negative adjustment due to the new MiFID regulation introduced in August 2022, as certain assets under management were reclassified from the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Reporting (SFDR) methodology.\nTotal volumes by business, during the fourth quarter and cumulative since January 1, 2020, were as follows:\nCorporate Bank: \u20ac 5 billion in sustainable financing, bringing the Corporate Bank\u2019s cumulative total to \u20ac 40 billion\nInvestment Bank: \u20ac 13 billion in sustainable financing and capital market issuance, for a cumulative total of \u20ac 128 billion\nPrivate Bank: volumes of \u20ac 1 billion during the quarter. The Private Bank\u2019s cumulative total at year end was \u20ac 48 billion, comprising \u20ac 10 billion in loans and \u20ac 37 billion in ESG investments.\nOn March 2, 2023, Deutsche Bank will host its second Sustainability Deep Dive. Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer, J\u00f6rg Eigendorf, Chief Sustainability Officer and other senior executives will provide updates on the bank\u2019s strategy, progress and outlook.\nGroup results at a glance\n\u00b9 For a description of this and other non-GAAP financial measures, see \u2018Use of non-GAAP financial measures\u2019 on pp 17-25 of the fourth quarter 2022 Financial Data Supplement\n\u00b2 Cumulative ESG volumes include sustainable financing (flow) and investments (stock) in the Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Private Bank from January 1, 2020 to date, as set forth in Deutsche Bank\u2019s Sustainability Deep Dive of May 20, 2021.
