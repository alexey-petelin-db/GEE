    "body": "Chief Investment Office presents twelve key themes that will lay the foundation for investments in 2024\nModerate growth is expected in industrialized economies whereas Asia remains the global growth engine\nCentral banks\u2019 rates are unlikely to return to previous extreme low levels\nToday Deutsche Bank Private Bank\u2019s Chief Investment Office (CIO) released its twelve key themes underpinning investment conditions in the new year.\nDespite the many current global challenges, prospects appear reasonably good for the main asset classes in 2024. But the big issue remains economic growth. Markets need to be convinced that growth will pick up again later in 2024. Investors also need to look forward to the risks and opportunities provided by more structural economic change.\nGlobal Chief Investment Officer Christian Nolting\nThe 12 key themes for next year are:\n(Geo)politics \u2013 Power play\nDomestic political developments are increasingly shaping foreign policy agendas \u2013 and 2024 will be the biggest election year in history.\nEconomy \u2013 Investing creates potential\nExpect only moderate growth in industrialised economies in 2024. The long-term challenge remains the delivery of investments to enhance economic competitiveness and fight climate change.\nInflation \u2013 Stage victory\nInflation is moderating but will stay above central bank target levels in 2024. This battle will take time to win.\nBonds \u2013 Real rates matter\nHigher yields have put bonds back centre-stage for investors \u2013 and investment grade could be the star. Prefer corporates over government bonds due to yield pick-up and sound fundamentals.\nFX \u2013 Be careful what you wish for\nProbably not a big year for FX moves, but the underlying reasons for currency strength will stay important: it\u2019s not always beneficial.\nStocks \u2013 Growth comes at a price\nRobust earnings growth is expected globally in 2024. Expectations of higher rates for longer may however put a lid on valuations expansion.\nSectors \u2013 Banking on tech\nU.S. growth stocks are probably still the way to go for the long term. European and Japanese financials could appeal too, as well as consumer discretionary, industrials and energy.\nCommodities \u2013 Terms of trade\nOil prices likely to rise, despite only moderate economic growth. Supply/demand impact more evident for industrial metals.\nAlternatives \u2013 Asset-backed value\nStill plenty of reasons to like alternatives, which may also be a good source of portfolio diversification. Infrastructure has many merits.\nESG \u2013 We are in this together.\nESG investment has gone mainstream, with performance implications. Energy transition may point the way to investing in the sustainable economy.\nRisks \u2013 De-risking risks\nBe aware that measures to create stability may just create new risks. Rates are still on our radar.\nPortfolio \u2013 Balanced bull\nThe longer-term focus has to be on growth. Reconsider bonds, monitor equity risks and always diversify.\nStefanie Holtze-Jen, CIO for Asia Pacific, said: \u201cAsia remains the growth engine of the global economy, with growth rates above developed economies. Our GDP forecast for China of 4.7% is based on continued growth-enhancing monetary and fiscal policy support, which should create a generally favourable backdrop for domestic investment, employment and thus private consumption in 2024. South East Asia\u2019s power economies of India and Indonesia are also contributing to Asia\u2019s momentum.\u201d\nDirk Steffen, CIO for Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: \u201cEurope is clearly in a soft patch, however we don\u2019t see a recession. Regardless, full employment and persisting wage pressure will lead the ECB to stay vigilant. European companies are in a very good position, though. We like European discretionary consumer companies that cater to secular global consumer trends. Furthermore, Europe's industrial companies play a major role in the green transformation, while financials benefit from the radically changed rate environment.\u201d\nDeepak Puri, CIO for the Americas, said: \u201cThe US economy continues to surprise on the upside but as we enter 2024 a bit of caution and conservatism is warranted. Financial conditions will remain tight and the effects of one of the most aggressive policy tightening programs may further complicate matters. We forecast an easing policy cycle by the second quarter of next year. In a nutshell, a slowing economy, policy easing and election year dynamics along with an ever-increasing role of AI will play a key role in investor positioning and asset class returns.\u201d\nThe full CIO Outlook 2024 report will be published on December 7, 2023 on deutschewealth.com.",
