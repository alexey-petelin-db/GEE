    "body": "We\u2019re celebrating the beginning of Pride Month and used some image editing skills to wrap our twin towers in the rainbow flag just as the artist Christo might have done it.\nWe wanted the outside of the towers to represent what #dbPride stands for: a working environment, where everyone can show their true colors at work. You can see the banner on Deutsche Bank\u2019s LinkedIn channel and we invite everyone who wants to support and celebrate pride to \nJPG\ndownload the banner and use it as banner of their own LinkedIn profile as well.\nPride Month is observed in June to honor the anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, a series of gay liberation protests in 1969. During pride month, we will participate in different activities all over the world aiming to promote diversity and inclusion. And of course, we will also share some stories about our pride activities as well as impressions of our employees on social media.\nFollow us on social media for more.",
