    "title": "Karl von Rohr to hand over Management Board responsibilities on July 1, 2023",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank President Karl von Rohr will hand over his responsibilities to his successors on July 1, following thorough handover work by the Management Board members involved and very good progress in preparing for the future leadership structure.\nClaudio de Sanctis will therefore take over responsibility for the Private Bank on July 1 and become a member of the Management Board. Alexander von zur M\u00fchlen will assume responsibility for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA, excluding the UK and Ireland) and Germany in addition to his existing mandate in the Asia-Pacific region, while Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke will assume additional responsibility for Asset Management; as announced by DWS Group, there is a separate process to select von Rohr\u2019s successor as Chairman of the DWS Supervisory Board.\nThe possibility of an earlier handover was already foreseen in the Supervisory Board resolution on Management Board personnel of April 26. The decision creates clear responsibilities at an early stage.\nAs previously announced, von Rohr will remain a member of the Management Board until his contract expires on October 31, 2023. He will provide advice to his successors and continue to support an orderly transition, especially with regard to the clients and other stakeholders he has served so far.",
