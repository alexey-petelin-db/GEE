    "body": "November 25, 2015 \n18:30 \u2013 20:00 GMT\nVenue: London School of Economics, Sheikh Zayed Lecture Theatre\nThe event will be live-streamed and presentations will be available on the website lsecities.net\n\nLuanda, Angola \u00a9 by Paulo Moreira\nSince 2006, over 134 million hectares of African land \u2013 roughly the size of France, Spain and Germany \u2013 has been bought by foreign investors, the region where urban growth is most expected in the next 20 years. At the same time large swathes of global cities like London, New York and Paris are owned or being developed by foreign sovereign wealth funds and international corporate investors.\nLeading urban sociologist Saskia Sassen \u2013 who identified the global cities dynamic \u2013 argues that these new and tacit patterns of ownership are having a negative impact on the \u2018cityness\u2019, vibrancy and accessibility of urban systems by cutting off parts of the city from public use. Could this form of investment and speculation in cities and buildings be causing de-urbanisation? These issues will be debated with policymakers and leaders who have been involved in reshaping the structure of urban ownership and investment.\nSpeaker:\nSaskia Sassen, Robert S. Lynd Professor of Sociology, Columbia University, author Global Cities and Expulsions\nPanel:\nJean-Louis Missika, Deputy Mayor of Paris in charge of urbanism, architecture, the projects of Greater Paris, economic development and attractiveness\nAnthony Williams, Mayor of Washington DC 1999-2007, CEO and Executive Director, Federal City Council, Washington DC\nChair:\nCraig Calhoun, President and Director, London School of Economics and Political Science\nGlobal Debates series to celebrate ten years of the Urban Age programme\nLSE Cities and Deutsche Bank\u2019s Alfred Herrhausen Society, in association with Guardian Cities, is holding a series of public Global Debates to celebrate ten years of the Urban Age programme.
