    "body": "Jackson Pollock\u2019s \u201cMural\u201d (1943), one of the twentieth century's most historic and influential paintings, is travelling to Germany after its monumental cleaning campaign at the Getty Conservation Institute, Los Angeles. The exhibition \u201cJackson Pollock\u2019s \u2018Mural\u2019: Energy Made Visible\u201d focuses upon this seismic masterpiece and sets it in the context of more than forty other pieces by artists and photographers including Lee Krasner, Roberto Matta, Aaron Siskind, Gjon Mili, Barbara Morgan, Robert Motherwell, and Andy Warhol.\nOrganized by the University of Iowa Museum of Art (UIMA), the exhibition will feature at the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle from November 25, 2015, through April 10, 2016. \"This show offers a fresh insight into Jackson Pollock\u2019s achievement, its roots and its vast impact on subsequent art\u201d, says Sean O\u2019Harrow, director of the UIMA. \"Pollock\u2019s art during the period of World War II would lay the foundations for the radical abstractions that soon followed.\"\nDavid Anfam \u2013 senior consulting curator at the Clyfford Still Museum in Denver and the preeminent authority on Abstract Expressionism \u2013 is the exhibition\u2019s curator. \u201cAfter its conservation by the Getty,\u201d says Dr. Anfam, \u201cPollock\u2019s \u2018Mural\u2019 has in effect been restored to its original, breathtaking power and intensity.\u201d Crucially, the conservation treatment removed a varnish that had been applied in 1973 and which subsequently became discoloured, altering the painting\u2019s entire appearance. Furthermore, the Getty built a new stretcher for \u201cMural\u201d and researched Pollock\u2019s complex painting technique.\nMeasuring 8\u2019 1\u00bc \u201d x 19\u2019 10\u201d, the immensely dynamic \u201cMural\u201d is the largest painting Pollock ever created and it continues to cast a long shadow over the course of American art down to the present day. \u201cMural\u201d established a new sense of epic scale, gesture, bold colourism and audacity for the incipient Abstract Expressionist movement, anticipating the classic \u201cpoured\u201d abstractions that Pollock began just four years later.\nA little history\nSetting \u201cMural\u201d into context, the selection includes several other Pollock canvases of the wartime period, including the enigmatic \u201cPortrait of H.M.\u201d, as well as works by Krasner (Pollock\u2019s wife), David Smith, and Motherwell, whose Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 126 (1965-75) was specifically conceived as a homage to Pollock\u2019s towering painterly panorama.\nCrucially, the selection also sheds new light on Pollock\u2019s relationship to photography, especially during the World War II era. At that time, such photographers as Herbert Matter, Barbara Morgan, Aaron Siskind, and Gjon Mili explored an imagery of rapid movement and Pollock certainly knew their work. In sum, \u201cMural\u201d embodied what Pollock later described as him key aim to make visible \u201cenergy and motion.\u201d\nPeggy Guggenheim, the leading collector of modern art in New York during the 1940s, was eager to showcase in her Manhattan townhouse a symbol of support for the new American brand of art she was beginning to champion in her Art of This Century gallery. Consequently, she commissioned Pollock to create a mural for the entrance hall of her apartment. At the suggestion of Guggenheim\u2019s friend and advisor Marcel Duchamp, it was painted on canvas, not the wall itself, so it would be, unlike many previous American murals, portable.\nPollock wrote of his commission that it was \u201c...with no strings as to what or how I paint it. I am going to paint it in oil on canvas. They are giving me a show November 16 and I want to have the painting finished for the show. I\u2019ve had to tear out the partition between the front and middle room to get the damned thing up. I have it stretched now. It looks pretty big, but exciting as all hell.\u201d\nMoving to Europe\nWhen Guggenheim decided to move back to Europe in 1947, she wanted to give the painting to an institution that she felt shared her approach to art and artists. Guggenheim, recognizing the significance of the university\u2019s forward-thinking studio art program, wrote to Prof. Lester Longman, head of the University of Iowa School of Art and Art History, in 1948. Finally, in 1951, the painting arrived in Iowa.\nApproximately half of the art works come from the collection of the UIMA. Other loans come from institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, and the Kunsthalle Bielefeld, as well as private collectors.\u201cJackson Pollock\u2019s \u2018Mural\u2019: Energy Made Visible\u201d arrives in Germany from its presentation at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Italy this summer. After its sojourn in Berlin, the exhibition will travel to the Museo Picasso in M\u00e1laga, Spain in 2016.\nThe exhibition tour is accompanied by a fully-illustrated book by David Anfam, published by Thames & Hudson.\nPhoto material on the exhibition can be downloaded free of charge for press purposes at Deutsche Bank KunstHalle.",
