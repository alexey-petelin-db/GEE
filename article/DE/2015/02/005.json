The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is also providing ECC with crucial credit enhancement support.\nThe ECC, which will finance 25 social enterprises including microfinance institutions (MFIs) expanding their offerings of financial products, has made its first round of loans to three organizations: Sproxil, a developer of a patented text message-based drug authentication system; Tiaxa, a provider of \u201cnanocredits\u201d to poor consumers in developing countries via mobile phones using big data analytics; and Arvand, a Tajikistan-based MFI providing innovative \u201cgreen loans\u201d to finance solar panels, clean cookstoves and other energy efficient products.\n\u201cThe Essential Capital Consortium is a pioneering fund that aims to finance the growth of social enterprises as vehicles to achieve measureable benefits in improving the lives of the poor, bringing together well-respected and similarly motivated investors to fill an existing capital gap,\u201d said Gary Hattem, Head of the Global Social Finance Group at Deutsche Bank. \u201cAs part of Deutsche Bank\u2019s ongoing commitment to microfinance and the impact industry, the ECC provides responsive debt capital to support the next generation of social entrepreneurs globally who are redefining a market approach to addressing fundamental humanitarian challenges.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank was the first global bank to establish a socially motivated microfinance fund in 1997, managed by its Global Social Finance Group. Since then, the Bank has partnered with more than 130 MFIs in more than 50 countries, benefitting as many as 3.8 million low-income entrepreneurs through USD 1.67 billion in financing.",
