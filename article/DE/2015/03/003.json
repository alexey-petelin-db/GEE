The Bank\u2019s announcement covers key strategic decisions, division-specific initiatives and financial targets.\nJ\u00fcrgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, Co-Chief Executive Officers, said: \u201cToday marks the next milestone in the journey we began in 2012. Deutsche Bank\u2019s course is clear. We reaffirm our commitment to being a leading global bank based in Germany. To achieve this, we must remain client-centric, but focus more sharply on mutually attractive client relationships; remain global, but become more geographically focused; and remain universal, but avoid trying to be all things to all people.\u201d\nThey continued: \u201cOur strategy review process was thorough and rigorous. We consulted key stakeholders and carefully evaluated different models. As a result of our strategy review, we are convinced that pursuing a focused client-centric business model is the right choice for us. This business model, which is unique to Deutsche Bank, will get us closer to our roots.\u201d\nThey concluded: \u201cOur course for the next five years is simple: we are focusing to deliver value. We are confident that, by 2020, Deutsche Bank will be better capitalized and less leveraged; more cost-efficient; well-funded; more value-creating for shareholders; and better governed, with stronger systems and controls. We look forward to celebrating Deutsche Bank\u2019s 150th anniversary by delivering results which are worthy of this great institution.\u201d\nSix new decisions\nAs a result of its strategy review process, the Bank took six new decisions which support the next phase of its strategy. The Bank\u2019s objectives are to:\nBuild a more focused, relationship-driven investment bank;\nReshape its retail business to focus on an advisory-led proposition and de-consolidate Postbank;\nDeploy digital technology across the platform;\nInvest to accelerate growth in GTB and Deutsche AWM;\nRationalize its geographical footprint by exiting or reducing its presence in some countries;\nTransform its operating model to achieve higher efficiency, reduced complexity, better resilience and resolvability.\nStrategy 2020 in Deutsche Bank\u2019s core businesses\nCorporate Banking & Securities (CB&S) has gained market share while reducing balance sheet resources and selectively exiting lower-return business since 2012. In the next phase, CB&S aims further to de-emphasize lower-return business, increase its focus on client solutions and invest in growth in higher-return products. CB&S plans to reduce gross leverage by approximately EUR 200 billion, while redeploying EUR 50-70 billion to improve its position in relationship-driven businesses.\nPrivate & Business Clients (PBC) will focus on developing a leading advisory-driven, omni-channel proposition for private and commercial clients requiring a superior product offering. Between now and 2020, PBC aims to invest some EUR 400-500 million in digital technology. It also plans to reduce its branch network by up to 200 branches by 2017. PBC aims to remain a leader in Germany with strong positions in five other attractive European markets, serving over 13 million customers. The Bank envisages that it will re-IPO Postbank and expect its deconsolidation by the end of 2016.\nGlobal Transaction Banking (GTB): Strategy 2020 aims to maximize GTB\u2019s strong global franchise, client synergies with CB&S, growth potential, attractive returns and net liquidity. Through 2020, the Bank plans to invest more than a cumulative EUR 1 billion in GTB\u2019s platform and increase leverage exposure by more than EUR 50 billion to support GTB\u2019s business with corporate and financial institution clients. GTB will also adapt its delivery model to focus on hub locations and focus more closely on the most mutually beneficial client relationships.\nDeutsche Asset & Wealth Management (Deutsche AWM) has gained considerable traction after an intensive restructuring launched in 2012. The business aims to accelerate growth by expanding its balance sheet by 5-10% per year until 2020, increasing the number of relationship managers by 15% in key markets, adding product specialists, and developing innovative products in growing asset classes.\nA more digital bank\nAcross all four businesses, the Bank will substantially invest in digital technologies. The Bank plans to invest up to EUR 1 billion additionally over the next three to five years in digitization to capture new revenue opportunities, for example, through remote advisory channels; realize platform efficiencies through automated or digitized processes; and develop new client propositions.\nFocusing Deutsche Bank\u2019s geographical footprint\nThe next phase of the Bank\u2019s strategy recognizes that centers of global economic power are shifting toward key emerging markets and cities. Through 2020, the Bank\u2019s objective is to refocus its global footprint, reducing the number of countries or local presences by 10-15% and actively investing in markets and urban centres which are most relevant to international and multinational clients, play to the Bank\u2019s existing strengths, and offer the most attractive growth prospects for the Bank\u2019s core businesses.\nTransforming the operating model\nThe Bank aims to transform its operating model by simplifying its structure, strengthening its controls, and becoming more efficient, more resilient and more resolvable. Strategy 2020 targets additional annual gross savings of EUR 3.5 billion by 2020. Of these, the Bank aims to realize approximately 60% by efficiency improvements arising from digitization, infrastructure adjustments and other measures, and approximately 40% from rightsizing the platform as the Bank exits structurally unprofitable businesses, focuses its geographic footprint and reduces its branch network. To achieve these savings, Strategy 2020 foresees one-time costs to achieve of EUR 3.7 billion.\nThrough its existing Operational Excellence program, the Bank delivered EUR 3.3 billion of savings as of the end of 2014 and plans to deliver a further EUR 1.2 billion by the end of this year.\nMedium-term financial ambitions\nThe next phase of the Bank\u2019s strategy sets clear financial ambitions for the medium term: a leverage ratio at or in excess of 5%, a CRD 4 Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of approximately 11%, a cost-income ratio of approximately 65% and a post-tax return on tangible equity of more than 10%. The Bank aspires to a payout ratio of 50% or more from dividends and, potentially, share buybacks.\nThe Bank will provide further details of execution, including its plans by business division, infrastructure function and region, decisions on geographical footprint optimisation and implementation timeline, within the next 90 days.",
