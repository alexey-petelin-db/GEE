    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) will fundamentally change its group and leadership structure. At an extraordinary meeting today in Frankfurt, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank resolved to restructure the Bank\u00b4s business divisions. This will be supplemented by a reorganization of executive committees and senior management changes.\n\nThe Supervisory Board\u2019s guiding principle, in light of the Bank\u2019s Strategy 2020, was to reduce complexity of the Bank\u2019s management structure enabling it to better meet client demands and requirements of supervisory authorities.\n\nThe Corporate Banking & Securities (CB&S) business division is a main focus of the organizational restructuring and will be split into two business divisions. Effective January 1, 2016, a business division called Corporate & Investment Banking will be created by combining the Corporate Finance business in CB&S and Global Transaction Banking (GTB).\nCB&S\u2019s sales and trading activities will be combined in a newly created business division called Global Markets. The name \u201cCB&S\u201d will cease to exist.\n\nAdditional changes will affect Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management. High net worth clients will be served by Private Wealth Management which will be run as an independent business unit within the Private & Business Clients business division. Deutsche Asset Management will become a stand-alone business division and focus exclusively on institutional clients and the funds business.\n\nTogether with the organizational restructuring there will be a broad-based change of key management roles. The Group Executive Committee (GEC) will be abolished, as will ten of the current 16 Management Board committees. Effective January 1, 2016, all four core business divisions will be represented directly on the Management Board. A ten-person Management Board will be supplemented by four General Managers (\u201cGeneralbevollm\u00e4chtigte\u201d).\n\nEffective January 1, 2016, Jeff Urwin, currently Co-Head of CB&S together with Colin Fan, will join the Management Board. Urwin will be responsible for Corporate & Investment Banking. As a result of this reorganization, Stefan Krause, a long-term Management Board member with responsibility for GTB and the Non-Core Operations Unit (NCOU), will resign effective October 31, 2015.\n\nWerner Steinmueller will remain Head of GTB, and will report to Urwin. He will be proposed for election to succeed Krause as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Postbank AG.\n\nColin Fan, currently Co-Head of CB&S, will resign effective October 19, 2015. He will be succeeded by Garth Ritchie who will be responsible for Global Markets on the Management Board effective January 1, 2016. Ritchie is currently Head of Equities.\nQuintin Price, most recently Global Executive Committee member and Head of Alpha Strategies at BlackRock, will take on Management Board responsibility for Deutsche Asset Management, effective January 1, 2016. Michele Faissola, Head of Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, will leave the Bank after a transition period.\n\nGoing forward, Christian Sewing, Head of Private & Business Clients, will also assume responsibility for high net worth clients on the Management Board. Fabrizio Campelli, currently Head of Group Strategy, will run this business and will report to Sewing.\n\nEffective October 31, 2015, Stephan Leithner has requested to resign as a member of the Management Board as he wants to assume a new role in the private equity industry next year. The Supervisory Board has accepted his request. Leithner is CEO Europe and is responsible for Human Resources, Government & Regulatory Affairs (GRAD), and Anti-Financial Crime on the Management Board.\n\nKrause and Leithner\u00b4s Management Board responsibilities will be divided as follows:\nSylvie Matherat, Head of Government & Regulatory Affairs at Deutsche Bank and a former Member of the Board of Directors of Banque de France, will become Chief Regulatory Officer and assume Management Board responsibility for Regulation, Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime. The General Manager (\u201cGeneralbevollm\u00e4chtigte\u201d) Nadine Faruque, who is Global Head of Compliance, will report to Matherat.\n\nKarl von Rohr, currently Chief Operating Officer for global Regional Management will become Chief Administrative Officer and assume Management Board responsibility for Corporate Governance, Human Resources, and Legal. In his new position, he will also become Labour Relations Director (\u201cArbeitsdirektor\u201d) of Deutsche Bank. Legal was represented on the Management Board by Co-Chief Executive Officer John Cryan.\nCryan will assume Management Board responsibility for the NCOU.\n\nSeparately, Kim Hammonds, currently Global Chief Information Officer and Co-Head of Group Technology & Operations at Deutsche Bank and formerly Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Boeing, will become Chief Operating Officer. She will oversee the re-engineering of the Bank\u2019s information technology (IT) systems and operations. To acquire the relevant experience in credit assessment in accordance with the German Banking Act (KWG), Hammonds will start her role as General Manager (\u201cGeneralbevollm\u00e4chtigte\u201d) at the beginning of next year. She is expected to join the Management Board in no later than one year.\n\nHenry Ritchotte, currently Chief Operating Officer, will leave the Management Board at year end and set up a new digital bank for Deutsche Bank. The Management Board will communicate further details about this project at a later point in time.\nIn addition to Faruque and Hammonds, Jacques Brand will become a General Manager (\u201cGeneralbevollm\u00e4chtigter\u201d) reporting to the Co-CEOs John Cryan and Juergen Fitschen, effective November 1, 2015. Brand is currently Chief Executive Officer for North America and will become Chairman of the newly created Intermediate Holding Company for the US business. Fitschen will remain responsible for global Regional Management.\n  Deutsche Bank AG\nTaunusanlage 12\n60325 Frankfurt am Main\nGermany\nISIN: DE0005140008\nWKN: 514000\nListed: Regulated market in Berlin-Bremen, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt (Prime Standard), Hamburg, Hanover, Munich und Stuttgart; EUREX; NYSE\nThe International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) of further financial instruments issued by Deutsche Bank AG, and admitted to trading on a domestic organized market or for which such admission has been applied for, are listed in the attached PDFs.",
