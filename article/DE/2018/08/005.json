    "title": "The rapid rise of the Bucharest Technology Centre",
    "body": "As banks develop into technology-led companies, the demand for in-house technology and engineering expertise has exploded.\nA shining example can be found in Bucharest, where a Deutsche Bank Technology Centre is celebrating five years of rapid growth and success.\nWhat started in 2013 with less than 200 people has developed into one of Deutsche Bank\u2019s most creative spaces, housing 900 technology experts.\n  Multi-talented, multi-faceted\nThe Bucharest teams cover a wide range of disciplines including project management, architecture, business and technology analysis, software development, as well as quality assurance. This allows the centre to build and run projects independently from start to finish; a simple recipe for innovation to thrive.\nDepartments including the Private & Commercial Bank, Anti-Financial Crime and the Corporate & Investment Bank have benefitted from the work driven out of Bucharest, which includes developing the Android version of the Deutsche Bank Mobile App \u2013 in partnership with the Digital Factory in Frankfurt.\nDuring 2013-2018, the teams successfully delivered 500 international technology projects and more than 750 software releases for the bank\u2019s mobile banking and trading systems.\n  Award-winning reputation as an attractive employer\nBy the time the centre opened, Bucharest was already well known for its skilled labour force. It was a challenge to attract enough highly skilled IT professionals from the local community, with strong competition from leading international technology companies.\n\u201cWe are hiring talents not for jobs, but for careers,\u201d Marian V. Popa, the head of the centre, emphasised. \u201cWith our strong focus on investing in our people and offering them an attractive working environment and career opportunities, we have built up a strong reputation in the local community,\u201d he said.\nThis approach has been acknowledged externally. In 2014 the centre was recognised as one of the top five IT companies to work for in Romania and ranked in the top 10 in 2015 \u2013 ahead of some major global technology companies.\nWith 40 percent female employees and 75 percent millennials, the centre is now one of the bank\u2019s most diverse and vibrant locations. The attractive working environment and career opportunities has also attracted Romanian IT professionals who had moved abroad to return home. \u201cWe were convinced that we can provide real opportunities to these professionals, similar to what they can find in Western European countries,\u201d Popa said.",
