    "body": "Deutsche Bank, in conjunction with the rock band Pearl Jam, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Raikes Foundation, is partnering with DonorsChoose.org to combat student homelessness.\nAccording to a Civic Enterprises and Hart Research Associates report, approximately 1.3 million students throughout America are currently homeless.\nWith an eye to addressing this tragedy, DonorsChoose.org, an innovative platform that connects individuals to communities and classrooms, is now accepting donations for teacher- and student-led projects. The projects, which vary from school to school and city to city, range from providing homeless students with high quality educational resources to supporting local initiatives designed to reduce student homelessness.\nTo this effect, Deutsche Bank is crediting its U.S. employees $50 to fund DonorsChoose.org student homelessness projects of their choosing.\n\u201cStudent homelessness is a serious issue, and it demands a serious response,\u201d said John Eydenberg, Chairman, Deutsche Bank Americas. \u201cWe hope this partnership will raise awareness and redirect more resources to help students without a home.\u201d",
