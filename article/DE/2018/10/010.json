    "body": "Tiina Lee spoke to the German financial daily Handelsblatt about London\u2019s future role for the financial markets, the impact of Brexit and her career at the bank. She is head of the bank\u2019s business operations in the UK and Ireland.\nHere are Lee\u2019s key messages:\nOverall, the bank will transfer fewer jobs away from London due to Brexit than originally expected: the number is likely to be no more than a few hundred by the end of March 2019. \u201cWe are better positioned than many other institutions, because we already have a substantial presence in the EU.\u201d\nThe bank is well equipped for Brexit. Lee spends about 25 percent of her working hours on preparations for this event. Planning efforts in the bank are being stepped up the closer the March 29, 2019 deadline approaches.\nPost-Brexit, London will also remain a very important financial location. The planned move to the new regional head office in a few years sends an important signal of Deutsche Bank\u2019s commitment to London. It is currently under construction and is just around the corner from Winchester House, the building that has been Deutsche Bank\u2019s London head office for many years.\n\u201cThe UK and Ireland remain a key region for Deutsche Bank\u201d.\nLee herself has close ties with the London financial district. \u201cI\u2019ve spent almost my entire career here,\u201d she said. She has been with Deutsche Bank for more than 20 years, having previously worked for Lehman Brothers.",
