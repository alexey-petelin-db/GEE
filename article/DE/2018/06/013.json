    "body": "Deutsche Bank is celebrating Pride season by participating in marches across the world, including Frankfurt, London and New York.\nThe events commemorate the New York Stonewall uprising of June 1969 when lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people stood up against police brutality in the fight for equality. The New York march was held earlier this month.\nFor decades, Deutsche Bank has been promoting equality under the law for LGBT+ individuals. In doing so, the bank strives to create an environment where all colleagues can bring their true selves to work in order to make their own #positiveimpact.\nFor the first time ever, Deutsche Bank will be joining the London Pride parade on July 7 with a custom designed float. London school children will also be marching alongside the Deutsche Bank float in another unprecedented first.\nStuart Lewis, Chief Risk Officer and dbPride Sponsor in the UK and Ireland, commented, \u201cSchool can be tough. Bullying affects high proportions of LGBTQ+ pupils. We want to tackle bullying in schools by developing diversity, inclusion and advocacy skills among young people.\u201d\nOur Berlin-Kurf\u00fcrstendamm branch on the famous Ku\u2019damm will be playing a star role in the city\u2019s Pride parade. Decorated in rainbow colours, the branch will be the official start line for the Berlin Pride march.\nOther events will be held in Cologne, Dublin, Manila, Milan and Stuttgart.\nImpressions from the Pride March in New York City:",
