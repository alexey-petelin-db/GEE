As market performance in such late cycle environments can be good, his advice is to stay invested \u2013 but hedge\u201d.\nNolting also notes that \u201cif you are not invested, you have high opportunity costs\u201d \u2013 missing a few days of market upswing can cost investors heavily in terms of overall performance.",
