    "body": "At Deutsche Bank\u2019s 16th annual dbAccess China Conference, which opened in Beijing this week, 22 percent of investors polled said they view a company\u2019s environmental performance as a very important factor in investment decisions. A further 69 percent of respondents reported that while financial performance is still key, environmental performance is indeed a consideration. International investors\u2019 explicit focus on environmental factors is an important reflection of a broader shift in China\u2019s macro policy agenda, as the world\u2019s second largest economy seeks to strike the right balance between economic and environmental sustainability.\ndbAccess China is the region\u2019s pre-eminent investor forum on the outlook for China\u2019s companies, industry sectors and overall economy. This year the conference brought together nearly 200 corporates and 700 investors representing more than 300 buyside institutions, who participated in large group presentations on macroeconomic and key sector topics. Concurrently the bank helped arrange roughly 2,000 one-on-one meetings between companies and investors followed by 15 premium field trips and site visits across the country, giving investors the chance to see companies' manufacturing facilities or major development projects.\nWerner Steinmueller, CEO for Asia Pacific, opened the event with an address highlighting the importance of closing the knowledge gap that many international investors have with regard to China. He mentioned that typical questions from institutional investors range from the technical \u2013 \u201cwhat can international investors do with new investment channels such as Bond Connect and Stock Connect?\u201d to the thematic - \u201cwhat are the country\u2019s policymakers doing to address commonly mentioned economic concerns?\u201d\n\u201cDespite its ever growing importance in the world economy, China has in many ways remained a myth among the majority of the western investment community,\u201d Steinmueller said. \u201cIt has therefore become extremely important for organisations like Deutsche Bank to continue creating platforms that regularly bring together industry experts, investors, and corporates, to discuss matters of common interest. Through such discussions, myths are clarified, opportunities identified, and hopefully investment strategies can be formulated.\u201d\nDuring this year\u2019s conference, delegates had heated discussions and lively debate on a wide range of topics. Discussing China\u2019s extensive adoption of cashless payments, Shu Li, a core member of the Technology, Media and Telecommunications practice at Boston Consulting Group, said that mobile payments have directly replaced cash payments and achieved explosive growth in the country. Other prominent topics included China\u2019s financial market reforms, sector-level deleveraging, and property market development trends.",
