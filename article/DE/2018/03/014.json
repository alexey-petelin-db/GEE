    "title": "Deutsche Bank delivers faster, more transparent international payments",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank has significantly improved payments for its clients by investing in IT and cooperating with SWIFT.\n\u201cInternational payments are executed faster, more securely, and with more transparency. This significantly eases the burden on company finance departments in particular.\u201d This was the interim assessment of Michael Spiegel, Head of Cash Management at Deutsche Bank. For the first time, clients can obtain real-time information on the status of their payments.\nSince November 2017, Deutsche Bank has been using \u201cSWIFT gpi Service\u201d for international payments, for example from Germany and the USA. Deutsche Bank currently settles around ten percent of these transactions worldwide.\nCurrent data highlights the benefits for the bank\u2019s clients: Deutsche Bank executes some 90 percent of all gpi payments in less than 24 hours and nearly half of all payments in under 30 minutes, for example US dollar payments from Shanghai to Sydney. Some payments are even executed in less than one minute, e.g. US dollar transfers from the US to the UK or Germany.",
