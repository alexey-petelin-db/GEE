    "body": "Printers that require colleagues to swipe their ID cards before printing have saved 27 tonnes of waste paper a year.\nThe \u201cfollow me\u201d print technology has already driven a dramatic change with paper dropping from 35 percent of the total waste produced by the bank to 17 percent in 2017.\nNick Iles, Corporate Services, said the technology has reduced the bank\u2019s impact on the environment. \u201cThis has encouraged colleagues to print only when it is most needed. We have seen reductions in printing of up to 75 percent in some areas of the bank.\u201d\nHe also pointed to the wider environmental benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re able to reduce our carbon footprint by not having to order as much paper as we used to. The bank also uses less toner which also helps the environment.\u201d\nBefore the new printers were installed, paper was the largest contributor to waste produced by the bank, but is now the third largest component. The initiative has been successfully rolled out across Europe and is planned to be installed across the globe.",
