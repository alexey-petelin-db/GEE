Risk recognised Deutsche Bank for its strategy to \u201cpivot away from pure execution\u201d in light of a quiet market across the industry. The judges also pointed to the broad range of innovative technology services for clients as a key differentiator.\nExplaining its choice for Quant Research House of the Year, Risk praised the bank\u2019s quant research team, referring to one client\u2019s comment that Deutsche Bank \u201chas a gift for describing the finer points of complex ideas from machine learning to liquidity risk premia\u201d.

For investors, risk premia is a low cost alternative to investing in traditional hedge funds and combines multiple instruments taking long or short positions as well as using specific trading rules. Risk noted that Deutsche Bank \u201chas sought to carve a niche for itself developing bespoke portfolios of systematic, alternative risk premia strategies tailored to customers\u2019 individual investment objectives\u201d. Risk highlighted that Deutsche Bank has completed more than 60 such bespoke deals.\nHonouring the work of firms and individuals in the derivatives markets and risk management, the Risk Awards are the longest-running awards of their kind - over 30 years in existence.
