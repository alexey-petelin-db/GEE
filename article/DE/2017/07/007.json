    "title": "Bundestag elections 2017: who has convincing solutions to Germany's problems?",
    "body": "Political risks impact on business sentiment and financial markets. In this regard, poll outcomes surprised observers several times during the last 12 months. Against this background, German politics seem like a haven of stability. This should not, however, mask the fact that while the German economy is currently in good health, the new government will nevertheless face several major challenges. Globalisation, the future of Europe, the new geopolitical situation, climate change and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 demographic shifts, which are becoming ever clearer \u2013 each of these issues requires a political response.\nDeutsche Bank Research has launched a series of papers \u201cGermany Monitor \u2013 Bundestag elections 2017\u201d that aim to examine how the main political parties plan to address these and other important issues and analyse whether their proposed solutions are convincing. Of course, we do not aspire to provide a complete analysis of the election programmes.\nThe latest edition addresses the debate about a new security framework, examining the parties\u2019 positions on the latest European defence initiatives and the calls to meet NATO's 2 percent spending target. Full compliance would probably overstretch the current budget and thus necessitate adjustments to medium-term fiscal planning.",
