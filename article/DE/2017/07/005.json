    "body": "The Modi administration has been proactive in unleashing a plethora of new-generation reforms that promise to dramatically transform the Indian economy.\nWhile these game-changing reforms have the potential to raise India\u2019s GDP growth trajectory and drive sustainable longer-term benefits for companies willing to embrace the change, the economy will face near-term headwinds as it rebalances itself to these significant reforms.\nOur Corporate Day will provide investors with the opportunity to discuss how some of the companies in India are adjusting to the historic reforms and their implementation.",
