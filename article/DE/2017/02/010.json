The Fund \u2013 a first of its kind \u2013 began in 2016 and provides non-repayable grants for refugee-targeted social enterprises.\nIt is part of Made for Good, Deutsche Bank\u2019s enterprise programme for social good that aims to help start-ups and early-stage enterprises build momentum and capacity.\nIn the Impact Fund\u2019s founding year, 200,000 euros were set aside to help twelve social enterprises develop their business models. During the Impact Fund finale the remaining 60,000 euros were allocated. And it was an exciting contest: each of the finalists applied for the maximum grant of 25,000 euros to scale their business model.\nAfter impressive pitches, an expert jury \u2013 consisting of Arasch Charifi, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Head of Wealth Management Central Germany; Nicola Leske, Head of Communications SAP SE; Nadine F\u00f6rster, ISM Mainz; and Norbert Kunz, CEO Social Impact gGmbH \u2013 decided on the individual allocations.\nSix finalists \u2013 six winners!\nJUMEN was awarded the largest grant of 22,500 euros \u2013 it offers legal advice to help refugee children get into school.\nZuBaKa received 15,000 euros to continue coordinating offers for vocational orientation, language training and mentoring at local schools.\nWefugees\u00b4 online dialogue platform for refugees and volunteers won 7,500 euros from the Impact Fund.\nEed be Eed ('hand in hand') provides an online newspaper in Arabic written by refugees, for refugees.
