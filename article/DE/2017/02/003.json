    "body": "New York has joined an illustrious list of locations as part of Deutsche Bank\u2019s innovation labs. Berlin, London and Silicon Valley will be joined by \u201cThe City That Never Sleeps\u201d in the bank\u2019s efforts to explore new technologies in partnership with fintechs.\nRather than viewing fintechs as a threat, Deutsche Bank is proactively joining forces with these entrepreneurs to develop services that benefit clients. The innovation lab concept makes it straight forward for fintech firms to work with the bank so ideas quickly become reality.\nThe lab in Lower Manhattan\u2019s Fulton Center, a short walk from the bank\u2019s Wall Street office, will plug into a leading ecosystem of innovation in one of the world\u2019s largest financial hubs. It will explore exciting new areas including artificial intelligence, cloud technology and cyber security. Rather than just working in isolation, the four labs will also collaborate \u2013 creating a powerful, global network.\nThe launch event on March 20 gathered technology companies from the New York area alongside Deutsche Bank representatives including Kim Hammonds, Member of the Management Board and Group Chief Operating Officer and Elly Hardwick, Head of Innovation.\nThe Deutsche Bank Labs have three principal goals: to help the bank evaluate and adopt emerging technologies, to develop a culture of innovation and contribute to the bank's digital strategy.\nThe approach is already solving real issues. Examples include technology that tracks eye movements to make apps more intuitive; a tool for credit risk officers to easily gather client ratings and a monitoring product that identifies problems within applications and network infrastructure.\nAt the event, Hardwick welcomed more than 60 attendees from the bank and the fintech community. \u201cWe want to make Deutsche Bank the first stop for start-ups. Our innovation labs combine fresh ideas from fintechs with the scale, infrastructure and industry expertise of a global bank.\u201d\nHammonds spoke about the importance of the labs for the bank\u2019s broader digital strategy and the role they play in enhancing products and services to clients and enabling business growth. \u201cThe launch of the lab in New York is a further step in Deutsche Bank\u2019s plan to be active in top global innovation ecosystems to benefit our clients today and shape how banking will be done in the future. Success for me is pretty simple \u2013 we want new companies to want to work with us.\u201d\nLater in the evening, Hilary Mason, Founder & CEO, Fast Forward Labs, spoke about artificial intelligence and machine learning, two growing trends that are already disrupting business models. During a panel discussion, moderated by Hardwick, panelists JP Rangaswami, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Group Chief Data Officer & Group Head of Innovation, Scott Robinson, Founder & VP, Plug and Play and George Davis, Co-founder and CEO, Frame.ai discussed the importance of partnership with the labs.\n\u201cGetting value we want from the technology while balancing safety and soundness is where the partnership really comes in,\u201d Rangaswami said.",
