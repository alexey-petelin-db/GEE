    "body": "From March 24 to June 18, the KunstHalle is presenting \u201cBird Song\u201d, the first institutional solo exhibition of the South African artist Kemang Wa Lehulere. Deutsche Bank\u2019s current \u201cArtist of the Year\u201d \u2013 one of the most important contemporary artists of his generation in South Africa \u2013 gives insight into his artistic cosmos in Berlin with many works conceived expressly for the show.\n\nThe starting point for \u201cBird Song\u201d is the artist Gladys Mgudlandlu (1917-1979). Wa Lehulere documents his research on the long-forgotten South African painter with texts and videos. He combines Mgudlandlu\u2019s watercolors and drawings with blackboard and ink drawings as a kind of artistic dialog between present and past.\nAlso on view are two new installations, a wall carving and a video work. Their visual language is touching yet also of universal quality. Wa Lehulere begins his artistic quest with a journey into South Africa\u2019s traumatic past and continues it with universal themes such as suppression and ideological conditioning.\n\nIn addition to solo shows \u2013 most recently until the beginning of 2017 at the Art Institute of Chicago \u2013 Kemang Wa Lehulere, who was born in Cape Town, has taken part in many international group exhibitions, including the 12th Dak\u2019Art Biennale in Dakar (2016), the 2nd Triennial of the New Museum in New York (2012), and the 11th Biennale de Lyon (2011).\nIn Berlin, works by the artist were shown in 2014 as part of the 8th Berlin Biennale at the Museum Dahlem and in 2013/2014 at the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle in the context of the exhibition project \u201cThe Circle Walked Casually.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition was curated by Britta F\u00e4rber, Chief Curator in Deutsche Bank\u2019s Art, Culture & Sports department. As an exclusive edition for the show, Kemang Wa Lehulere and the free jazz musician Mandla Mlangeni recorded an album and composed all of the pieces themselves. Titled \u201cbird song album,\u201d the vinyl record has been published in a numbered edition of 300 copies of which 40 were signed.\n\nAccompanying the exhibition is the catalog \u201cKemang Wa Lehulere: Bird Song. \u2018Artist of the Year\u2019 2017\u201d with contributions by Elvira Dyangani Ose, Britta F\u00e4rber, Carlos Gamerro, Victoria Noorthoorn, and Kate Nesin (German/English, \u20ac 35).\nFollowing the presentation at the KunstHalle, with a supporting program for children, youth, and families, \u201cKemang Wa Lehulere: Bird Song\u201d will be on view at MAXXI, Rome, until November 2017.\nPress photos on the exhibition can be found at: http://www.photo-files.de/\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s commitment to art is part of the activities of the bank\u2019s Art, Culture & Sports department.
