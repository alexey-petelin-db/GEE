    "body": "Scientists say if carbon emissions grow unchecked, global warming could, in an extreme scenario, exceed five degree centigrade by the end of this century, wiping out 95% of the planet\u2019s species. Instead, the Paris climate change agreement seeks to limit global warming to two degrees centigrade by halving carbon emissions relative to their current trends by 2040.\nWhat does this mean for economic growth? Who will be the winners and who will be the losers of this trend?\nWatch our new #dbinsights video for a peek into the post-carbon world.\nIt summarizes the feature story of the latest\nPDF\nissue of konzept \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research\u2019s flagship magazine \u2013 that introduces the Deutsche Carbon Alignment Framework. It is a new approach to thinking about the transition to a low-carbon world. DeCAF is based on the fact that volume goals and value creation are not necessarily aligned. Understanding the relationship between them makes picking winners from decarbonisation much easier.",
