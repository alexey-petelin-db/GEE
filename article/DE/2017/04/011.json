    "body": "The quarterly report highlights the current market environment and second quarter outlook providing our house view and hedge fund strategy forecasts.\nOf particular focus in this edition is the continued and ongoing fallout of the UK and EU divorce, while the US demonstrated divisions in the ruling Republican party raising questions about the efficacy of Trump\u2019s administration to pass legislation. Despite this, investors have taken solace from the encouraging macroeconomic data from both sides of the Atlantic.\nThis more positive economic growth outlook largely led by the US comes at a time when inflationary pressures appear to be building, driven, the report suggests, by both domestic labour market tightening and potentially higher oil prices.\n\"We feel that the outlook for hedge fund returns is indeed improving driven by divergent monetary policies, greater uncertainty and the re-emergence of inflation in the world\u2019s largest economies,\" note the authors of the report.\nBelow is a visual summary of the key forecasts for each hedge fund strategy.",
