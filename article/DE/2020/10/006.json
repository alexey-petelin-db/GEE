The bank now operates cash management services in 35 locations globally, 14 of which are in Asia Pacific.\nAustralia\u2019s interim CEO Glenn Morgan says adding Australia to the bank\u2019s global network of cash management businesses will be \u201ca terrific boost for local employees.\u201d\nLaunching a new business that is a key to the bank\u2019s global growth and global client base reaffirms the commitment to our local franchise as a whole.\nGlenn Morgan\n14 new roles have been added to support the new business, including John Godlonton who joins from Deutsche Bank Singapore as Head of Cash Product, Australia. The business offers a range of services including current accounts and deposit products, domestic and cross- border payments and collections as well as liquidity management services.\nCash Management is strategically important for the bank\u2019s Australian franchise says Australia\u2019s Head of Corporate Bank Peter Connor. \u201cCash Management will expand our footprint by servicing a larger set of our multi-national corporates. Clients have been asking us to introduce cash management services for some time now so we\u2019re excited to add that capability to our product suite. We are in a strong competitive position and are confident we can build market share.\u201d \nDeutsche Bank has operated a Corporate Transactional Banking business in Australia for over five years providing a range of products including Trade Finance, Foreign Exchange and Trust and Agency Services. Cash Management rounds out that offering.   \nAustralia presents a significant opportunity for the bank and for our European clients operating there. Over 250 of our existing global Cash Management clients operating there are using other banks and our initial dialogue with them around our new business has been really encouraging. We also plan to expand our coverage of domestic clients with global needs.\nStefan Hoops, Global Head of Corporate Bank\nCash Management is not only at the centre of the Corporate Bank and key to its growth ambitions, says Ole Matthiessen, Global Head of Cash Management. \u201cDuring the current crisis, it became very clear that it is even more important for treasurers to analyze and act upon the continuously evolving developments in the market.
