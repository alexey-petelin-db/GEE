    "body": "The blue economy\nThe world\u2019s eighth-largest economy is based not on land but in the oceans, with at least USD 2.5 trillion a year generated by marine resources, estimates from the World Wide Fund for Nature show. Yet even this may be understating the power and importance of the \u201cblue economy\u201d, according to a new report from the Chief Investment Office of Deutsche Bank\u2019s International Private Bank (IPB).\n\u201cThe concept of the blue economy is inextricably linked with biodiversity \u2013 and biodiversity underpins the \u2018ecosystem services\u2019 that humans receive from nature,\u201d writes Christian Nolting, Global Chief Investment Officer and Head of Investment Solutions at the IPB.A complex economic system. The blue economy should be regarded not as a simple resource in isolation but as a complex economic system, Nolting writes. The challenge is to conserve marine resources \u2013 estimated by the WWF to be worth USD 24.2 trillion \u2013 while allowing for sustainable development.\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, international collaboration and sustainable business practices will be critical to the oceans\u2019 future, according to the report, which includes contributions both from the CIO team and from external specialists.\nOcean biodiversity is thought to provide so-called regenerative returns worth around USD 125 trillion to USD 140 trillion a year, or more than 1.5 times that of conventionally measured global GDP, the independent Dasgupta Review found earlier this year. \u201cThis will not be a situation where everything is fixed quickly,\u201d Nolting writes. Nevertheless, \u201cthe blue economy has an immediate importance for investors \u2013 both in terms of opportunities and risks.\u201d\nThe report was published to coincide with \u201cWealth with Responsibility: Healing and Protecting Our Oceans\u201d, an IPB event that brought together some of the world\u2019s leading authorities in ocean conservation and the blue economy.",
