We are very encouraged by Christiana\u2019s and the bank\u2019s commitment to making DB a more inclusive workforce and proud to help drive the progress the firm is making across ethnic and racial diversity.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we rang the bell we were celebrating all the hard work that has got us to where we are now. But we were also marking the way forward from here as we tackle this issue with more passion and focus,\u201d said Christiana.\nBLF is part of the Multicultural Partnership (MCP), an Employee Resource Group.
