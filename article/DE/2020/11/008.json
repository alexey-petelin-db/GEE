Our relief efforts with Caritas helped more than 3200 vulnerable families across many districts1 who were in desperate need of essential food,\u201d Arora said.\nFor as little at 10 Euros (LKR 2267) per family, Deutsche Bank funded 3200 Food Packs, which contained rice, flour, dhal, sugar, tea leaves, milk powder, coconut, noodles, chilli powder, soya, as well as face masks, hand sanitizer, and soap.\nSeth Sarana Caritas Colombo, Fr. Lawrence Ramanayake said: \u201cWe identified the most marginalized segments of the community to receive this support - single mothers with young school-going children, young widows with children, low income families with disabled members, and the elderly \u2013 and arranged distribution. You could see the relief in their eyes,\u201d he added.\nOther bank initiatives included the employee \u201cSteps Challenge\u201d which saw 60 employees in Sri Lanka take more than 15 million steps over 40 days, to mark Deutsche Bank\u2019s 40th anniversary in Sri Lanka this year and to fundraise for the needy. This distance was the equivalent of each staff member walking six kilometres per day.\nFor further information please contact:\nDeutsche Bank AG Media Relations\nSarah Stabler\nPhone: +65 6423 8413\nEmail: sarah.stabler@db.com\nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides retail and private banking, corporate and transaction banking, lending, asset and wealth management products and services as well as focused investment banking to private individuals, small and medium-sized companies, corporations, governments and institutional investors.
