    "body": "Vaccine roll-outs offer the hope of putting the coronavirus pandemic behind us during 2021, but we should not expect a simple return to life \u201cpre-COVID\u201d, according to a new report by Deutsche Bank\u2019s International Private Bank.\nMultiple impacts \u2013 to individuals, businesses and governments \u2013 from the pandemic will not be fully reversed, according to the Chief Investment Office\u2019s Annual Outlook for 2021, published today and entitled \u201cTectonic shifts: looking beyond COVID-19\u201d.\nThey include increased concerns about inequality in terms of wealth and opportunity, a bigger role for the state in people\u2019s lives \u2013 supported by new digital technologies \u2013 and a rethinking of how we use our infrastructure.\nMeanwhile, further pressure on fiscal and policy will add to worries about debt and future inflation. These impacts therefore fall under \u201c4Ds\u201d \u2013 divergence, demographics, digitalisation and debt.\n\u201cAs well as creating new problems, the pandemic has also accelerated or exacerbated many pre-existing economic and investment trends,\u201d Christian Nolting, Chief Investment Officer, writes in the report. \u201cAn investment response needs to be not just tactical, but also strategic. \u201cIt makes sense to invest in key themes that will play an increasing role in long-term global development.\u201d\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are likely to play an increasingly important role in any investment strategy. More key investment themes are described within our \"TEDS\" triangle \u2013 defined by the three issues of technology, demographics and sustainability.\nThe report also includes economic forecasts for 2021 and 2022, along with individual asset class outlook summaries and forecasts to end-2021.",
