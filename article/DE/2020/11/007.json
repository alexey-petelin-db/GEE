    "title": "GlobalCapital applauds Deutsche Bank for COVID response and leading landmark transactions for clients in Asia",
    "body": "\u201cOne bank stood out for its comprehensive response to the coronavirus crisis when faced with a test of resilience and when standard business continuity plans no longer applied,\u201d said GlobalCapital Asia, naming Deutsche Bank the best bank in the region for handling the pandemic.\nThe publication continued: \u201cFor understanding the tone of market rapidity, offering innovative and much-needed solutions to its client base and for adjusting its focus in line with the changing conditions, Deutsche Bank deserves kudos for its COVID response.\u201d\nThis is the second time the bank has been commended for rising to the challenge of COVID, having won \u2018Crisis Response of the Year\u2019 from AsiaRisk in September.\n\u201cWinning another \u201cBest COVID Response\u201d award this year is testament to the resilience and agility of our people and platform, from front of house through to our back line. We are super proud of how well we\u2019ve held up and supported clients this year,\u201d said Michael Connolly, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Operating Officer for the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank in APAC.\nAward-winning adaptability and tailored transactions\nThe bank\u2019s award-winning Autobahn app allowed clients to execute and settle trades safely, said the publication. This resulted in a 300% increase in client demand for electronic execution access to onshore markets across Asia. For clients facing a sudden shortage of funding, the bank also offered dollar liquidity support, cited GlobalCapital.\nWe tailored solutions to meet our clients\u2019 needs. These included setting up a new legal entity for a client in India through a complex capital injection during lock down and processing an overseas payment that helped a client in Portugal and its China shareholder donate potentially life-saving medical equipment to Portuguese hospitals.\nIn capital markets, \u201cDeutsche Bank was part of most, if not all, key themes this year, including the spike in liability management and ESG-focused transactions,\u201d said GlobalCapital, citing the bank\u2019s roles in helping Sriram Transport raise 500 million US dollars in India\u2019s first public international social bond and helping Kaisa Group launch the first sustainable perpetual bond in China\u2019s high yield market.\nAmit Khattar, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Head of Investment Bank for APAC, said: \u201cParticularly in a year like 2020, it is fantastic for the bank to be recognised for its role in helping clients execute landmark transactions in the region. Despite the many challenges, the teams have continued to step up and provide unique and innovative solutions to clients.\u201d\nIn the equity market, GlobalCapital commended the bank for helping pharmaceutical company 3SBio simultaneously sell a euro convertible bond (CB) while repurchasing an old CB while mitigating a hit to their shares. Our loan team focused on executing more private transactions for existing clients, scooping wins in three out of four loan deal categories as a result.\nLeading in Loans\nThe bank won \u2018Best High Yield Syndicated Loan\u2019 for helping Trans Retail Indonesia on its 740 million US dollar loan and for helping execute Hexaware Technologies\u2019 take-private by Baring Private Equity for 600 million US dollars with \u2018Best Leveraged/Acquisition Finance\u2019 and \u2018Best Loan\u2019.\nBest bonds\nDeutsche Bank also won for roles on three ground-breaking bonds: \u2018Best SSA Bond\u2019 for the Republic of Indonesia\u2019s 4.3 billion US dollar Triple-tranche bond, \u2018Best HY Corporate Bond\u2019 for Vedanta Resource\u2019s 1.4 billion US dollar bond, and \u2018Best Project Finance Deal\u2019 for Star Energy\u2019s 790 million US dollar green bond. This deal also won \u2018Megatrend Deal of the Year (ESG)\u2019 and \u2018Best of South Asia\u2019 at this year\u2019s FinanceAsia Awards.",
