    "body": "The HERoes 100 Women Executives list celebrates women who are leading by example and driving change to increase gender diversity in the workplace. Americas CEO, Christiana Riley not only made the list, but also earned the number 5 spot out of 100. The HERoes judging panel scored each nominee on the influence of their role, their impact on women inside and outside the workplace, and their business achievements.\n\nChristiana shares the spotlight with other influential executives such as Jennifer Jackson, President, Capital One Canada; Ann Cairns, Executive Vice-Chairman, Mastercard; June Felix, CEO, IG Group; and Masami Katakura, Chairwoman & CEO, EY ShinNihon.\n\nServing as the first woman regional CEO at Deutsche Bank in our 150 year history, Christiana has committed to driving inclusion in the workplace and has set gender equality objectives for the region.
