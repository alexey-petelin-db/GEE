    "title": "Pandemic risks eclipse treasury priorities as businesses diversify investments to mitigate impact",
    "body": "The Covid-19 pandemic has shunted aside existing challenges to sit atop treasurers\u2019 priority lists, according to \u201cThe resilient treasury: Optimising strategy in the face of covid-19\u201d, a survey run by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and sponsored by Deutsche Bank.\nThe results show that treasurers are looking to diversify their investments in a bid to mitigate the pandemic impacts, including heightened liquidity, foreign-exchange and interest-rate risk. As many as 55% plan to increase investments in long-term instruments, with 48% increasing investments in bank deposits, another 48% in local investment products, and 47% in money-market funds.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has drastically altered business plans in 2020. It has placed a certain level of strain on treasury processes, but the challenge it presents has been managed by traditional treasury skills. It is clear that pandemic risk will be on the treasury checklist for years to come, but it is one of many risks the department faces and will continue to manage.\nMelanie Noronha, EIU editor of the report\nDespite Covid-19 looming large, other challenges wait in the wings. Notably, the replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate was identified by 38% of respondents as the main challenge of their function.\nTechnology, meanwhile, continues to be a pressing issue, with treasury teams becoming increasingly reliant on IT solutions. Here, data quality is rising up the list of concerns. Already highlighted as very or somewhat concerning in 2019 by 69% of respondents, the figure rose to 78% in 2020. Acquiring the necessary skill sets to realise the full benefits of this data and technology is also a continuing priority \u2013 with some progress registered from last year. In 2020, 30% of respondents say they have all the skills they need to manage technological change, up from 22% in 2018.\n\u201cTreasury\u2019s focus on technology is not only helping teams operate more efficiently in a remote-working environment, it has long played \u2013 and continues to play \u2013 a key role in realising their long-term priorities,\u201d notes Ole Matthiessen, Head of Cash Management, Corporate Bank, Deutsche Bank. The survey shows that managing relationships with banks and suppliers (highlighted by 32% of respondents) and collaborating with other functions of the business (also 32%) remain top of the agenda \u2013 and seamless digital systems will help give treasurers the bandwidth and insight to be more effective partners for both internal and external stakeholders.\nBased on a global survey of 300 treasury executives, conducted between April and May, the survey explores stakeholders\u2019 attitudes among corporate treasurers towards the drivers of strategic change in the treasury function \u2013 from the pandemic through to regulation and technology \u2013 and their priorities for the next five years.\nSee the findings and read the full report\nFor further information, please contact:\nHenry Williams\nPhone: +44 20 7539 3564\nE-Mail: henry.williams@finnpartners.com",
