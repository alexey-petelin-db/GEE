    "body": "Deutsche Bank Research is launching a second podcast series to its lineup: Behind the Headlines. This new series will see top decision makers at global corporations and institutions interviewed in-depth by Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Global Head of Credit Strategy and Thematic Research. Reid will be digging deep for insights.\nThe first two episodes feature Stefan Scholz, Group Treasurer at Continental and Henrik H\u00e4nche, Group Treasurer at Deutsche Post DHL. The topics range from working from home, supply chain disruption and ESG to the opportunities of low interest rates.\nTesla as a disruptor was a salient part of the conversation with Scholz. \u201cI underestimated Tesla in the beginning, Elon Musk has made really big steps forward. What I like at Tesla is that they were really progressive, disruptive, innovative. They introduced a kind of new technology that means they did not copy the existing IT infrastructure; they recognise that software is getting more important.\u201d\nAnother highlight is H\u00e4nche\u2019s take on changes in the treasury and financial markets: \u201cWhat we're going to see going forward is low interest rates which we have not seen 10 years ago. Who remembers that interest rates 10 years ago were around you know 5% for a 10 year bond, nobody remembers that. We are going to see low interest rates going forward and we need to live with it with all pros and cons\u201d.\nWhen asked whether cash raised, because of low interest rates and higher borrowing, could be used for M&A, H\u00e4nche responded that it depends which side you\u2019re on because for Deutsche Post DHL with huge pension obligations around the world, low discount rates also increase pension obligations; for H\u00e4nche it is a matter of how to balance it.\n\u2018Behind the Headlines with Jim Reid\u2019 will go where you go, when you want to go there.\nHosted on Deutsche Bank\u2019s Research website it is also accessible on Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts and Stitcher.\nEpisode 1: Stefan Scholz, Continental AG: Working from Home to Tesla to ESG\nEpisode 2: Henrik H\u00e4nche, Deutsche Post DHL Group: From globalisation to low interest rates",
