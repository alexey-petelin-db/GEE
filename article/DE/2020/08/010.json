    "title": "Central Bank Digital Currencies: money reinvented",
    "body": "Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) could change all financial relationships, argues the latest Deutsche Bank Wealth Management CIO report.\nCBDC can operate in several forms, but in most cases involve making transactions (between individuals, or government to individuals) directly through central bank accounts. The benefits from CBDC could include:\nIncreased transaction speed, security and transparency \u2013 with associated benefits in combating payments fraud and ensuring good corporate governance.\nMore effective monetary policy \u2013 for example through faster implementation of changes in monetary policy, or by removing the option to hold cash on investors\u2019 balance sheets, which CBDC would in some forms permit, and which would enable central banks to lower interest rates even deeper into negative territory.\nCBDC are currently being investigated by several central banks, with China and Sweden having undertaken trials. Major uncertainties remain about how full-scale CBDC would operate and about their implications for capital markets. Further, there are important concerns about potential threats to individuals\u2019 privacy. But, as the report points out, CBDC may soon become part of our lives, so societies need to learn how to use them best.\nPDF\nRead the CIO report.",
