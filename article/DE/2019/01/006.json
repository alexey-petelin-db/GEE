Deutsche Bank was mandated by the MOF as sole lead arranger, agent and lender.\nThe third transaction, of which Deutsche Bank acted as sole structuring bank and as sole lender on the financing package, relates to a social infrastructure development. Dubbed the \u201cthe 4 hospitals project\u201d, the combined 45 million euro financing agreement is dedicated to the financing of a supply contract between Contracta Costruzioni Italia Srl and Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Health for the modernization and equipping of selected existing health facilities in Ghana including the Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital, Kibi District Hospital, Aburi Hospital and Atibie Hospital.\nThe transaction follows the Italian Export Credit Agency \u201cSACE\u201d financing arranged in 2017 relating to the construction of the University of Environmental and Social Development in the Somaya region of Ghana. It confirms how social infrastructure is high on the agenda of the government of Ghana in the context of Ghana\u2019s Millennium Development Goals.\nDeutsche Bank in Africa\nSince opening a representative office in Cairo in 1959, Deutsche Bank has strongly contributed to financing the development of infrastructure across the African continent.
