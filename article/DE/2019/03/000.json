The US-based artist was selected for her extraordinary, mixed-media drawings of imaginary places and constructed spaces where a unique cast of characters float, dance, stretch, embrace or otherwise interact with nature and each other. Her large-scale dreamscapes evoke personal narratives about the elusiveness of home and notions of joy, hybridity and sensuality.\namanze pushes the traditional boundaries of two-dimensional drawing into the sculptural realm, often employing custom supports, colored glazing and shaped frames. Her practice also includes an appreciation of language, dance and performance. In collaboration with artist Wura-Natasha Ogunji, amanze will be staging twin: a performance + drawing, a three and a half hour performance where drawing becomes an improvisational action. Open to the public, the audience will watch as an artwork is created in real time by two women joined with one hand. The resulting drawing is a physical artifact and a testament of unity.\nWura-Natasha Ogunji and ruby onyinyechi amanze, Performance still from 2013 staging at the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Art (MoCADA), Brooklyn NY\nAbout Deutsche Bank Wealth Management\nWith client assets of approximately 300 billion euros (as at March 31, 2019), Deutsche Bank Wealth Management is one of the largest wealth managers worldwide.
