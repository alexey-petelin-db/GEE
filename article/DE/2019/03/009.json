    "body": "Political uncertainty in Europe and rising wages are among factors further weakening corporate earnings growth expectations ahead of Q2 results, according to Deutsche Bank Wealth Management (WM).\nIn its latest \u201cCIO Insights\u201d update, Christian Nolting, Chief Investment Officer for Deutsche Bank WM, says \u201cearnings growth expectations are already being revised down around the world and we expect that there is further to go here.\u201d\n\u201cEquities \u2013 Earnings ease\u201d is one of Nolting\u2019s six key investment themes for 2019, which he analyses and updates in the report.\nConcerns around Brexit and Italy as well as a potential escalation in global trade tensions (most notably affecting German exporters) mean \u201cfurther gains in European equities are likely to be limited,\u201d Nolting says. \u201cMoreover, despite recent downgrades, European earnings expectations still look too high and could be subject to further downward revisions.\u201d\nIn the US, the CIO team believes the trend for higher wages without an accompanying rise in inflation means companies lose a degree of pricing power to pass on higher costs to consumers. This limits potential future gains in revenues, \u201cwhich in turn might help explain the recent reduction in corporate earnings forecasts.\u201d\nFrom a global standpoint, equity market gains in Q1 were \u201ca reaction to the overselling in Q4 2018 rather than the beginning of a new trend.\u201d In fact, Nolting concludes, we expect equity returns over the next 12 months to be modest.\nThe six key investment themes for 2019 in light of economic and market developments so far can be summarised as follows:\n\u201cEconomy \u2013 Growth deceleration\u201d\n\u201cCapital markets \u2013 Vigilant on volatility\u201d\n\u201cFixed income \u2013 (U.S.) yields on the return\u201d\n\u201cEquities \u2013 Earnings ease\u201d\n\u201cFX and commodities: U.S. dollar and oil centre-stage\u201d\n\u201cTech transition\u201d\nIn the publication, Nolting and his team look how market gains can coexist with an outlook of slowing economic expansion and easing earnings growth, and whether the promise of continued accommodative monetary policy can remain credible. Portfolios may need to be realigned when appropriate to reflect problems ahead: \u201cuse rallies to reassess\u201d.",
