    "title": "Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank discontinue discussions",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) and Commerzbank decided today to discontinue their discussions concerning a combination of their businesses. After careful analysis it became apparent that such a combination would not be in the interests of either bank\u2019s shareholders or other stakeholders.\n\u201cIt made sense to evaluate this option for domestic consolidation in Germany. However, we were always clear: we needed to be convinced that any potential combination would generate higher and more sustainable returns for shareholders and allow us to enhance our value proposition to clients,\u201d said Christian Sewing, CEO of Deutsche Bank.\n\u201cAfter thorough analysis, we have concluded that this transaction would not have created sufficient benefits to offset the additional execution risks, restructuring costs and capital requirements associated with such a large-scale integration. I would like to thank Martin Zielke and everyone involved for the constructive discussions over the past few weeks.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank will continue to review all alternatives to improve long-term profitability and shareholder returns.\nFor the first quarter of 2019, Deutsche Bank expects to report income before income taxes of approximately 290 million euros and net income of approximately 200 million euros, after booking full-year 2019 bank levies of around 600 million euros in the quarter. Total revenues are expected to be 6.4 billion euros, including 3.3 billion euros in the Corporate & Investment Bank.\nTotal noninterest expenses and adjusted costs (1)  are each expected to be 5.9 billion euros, in both cases including the aforementioned bank levies. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter is expected to rise to approximately 13.7%, from 13.6% at the end of the previous quarter.\nDeutsche Bank achieved loan and deposit growth in the Private & Commercial Bank as well as loan growth in the Corporate & Investment Bank. Wealth Management and Asset Management recorded positive net inflows.\nChristian Sewing: \u201cOur preliminary results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and our continued progress in executing our plans in a very challenging market environment. We have made progress on key business drivers: growth in loans and deposits, a recovery in assets under management and market share improvements in corporate finance. Our continued cost discipline helped us to offset lower revenues, and we are well on track to meet our 2019 cost target of 21.8 billion euros.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank will report first quarter results on April 26, 2019, as scheduled.\n(1) Adjusted costs are noninterest expenses excluding impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, litigation, and restructuring and severance.\n\nFor further information please contact:\nDeutsche Bank AG\nMedia Relations\nChristian Streckert\nPhone: +49 69 910 38079\nEmail: christian.streckert@db.com\n\nTim-Oliver Ambrosius\nTel. +49 69 910-42648\nEmail: tim-oliver.ambrosius@db.com\nInvestor Relations\n+49 800 910 8000 (Frankfurt)\n+44 20 7541 4100 (London)\n+1 212 250 0604 (New York)\ndb.ir@db.com\nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides commercial and investment banking, retail banking, transaction banking and asset and wealth management products and services to corporations, governments, institutional investors, small and medium-sized businesses, and private individuals.
