    "body": "Frankfurt am Main, April 25, 2019 \u2013 10:35 CEST - After careful analysis, the Management Board of Deutsche Bank has concluded today that a combination with Commerzbank would not have created sufficient benefits to offset the additional execution risks, restructuring costs and capital requirements associated with such a large-scale integration. As a result, the two banks have decided to discontinue discussions.\nDeutsche Bank will continue to review all alternatives to improve long-term profitability and shareholder returns.\nFor the first quarter of 2019, Deutsche Bank expects to report income before income taxes of approximately EUR 290 million and net income of approximately EUR 200 million. Total net revenues are expected to be EUR 6.4 billion, including EUR 3.3 billion in the Corporate & Investment Bank with total noninterest expenses and adjusted costs in each case of EUR 5.9 billion.\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter is expected to be approximately 13.7 percent.\nDeutsche Bank will report first quarter results on April 26, 2019.",
