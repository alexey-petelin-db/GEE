    "body": "Deutsche Bank Wealth Management is growing with a \u201cbig investment push\u201d that includes plans to hire an additional 300 client-facing staff by 2021, Global Head Fabrizio Campelli told Reuters in an interview.\nThe growth plan is in line with Deutsche Bank\u2019s announcement last year that it aims to increase its share of revenues from more stable sources such as wealth management to 65 percent by 2021.\nThe business aims to increase the number of Relationship Managers and Investment Managers by about one third each, spread across the Americas, Emerging Markets and European home market regions, Campelli said in the interview. The plans, which also include investing in existing people, systems and technology, focus on macro trends such as the rise in entrepreneurs, emerging market wealth and family offices.\n\u201cThis drive to grow our business is now materialising with a big investment push,\u201d Campelli told Reuters.\n\u201cWe need to increase significantly our client footprint, which means the net increase of client facing individuals needs to be material,\u201d he said.\nRecent hires include Michael Rogers, who joined as the new head of the US West Coast business from Merrill Lynch, and Marco Pagliara from Goldman Sachs, the new head of Northern and Eastern European wealth management.",
