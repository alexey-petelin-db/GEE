    "title": "Deutsche Bank is No. 1 for China's Bond Connect",
    "body": "Onshore bond trading volume in China surged in July, making Deutsche Bank the top foreign bank by trading volume for China\u2019s Bond Connect scheme.\nBond Connect is China\u2019s mechanism for enabling foreign investors to access China\u2019s 13 trillion US dollar onshore bond market \u2013 the world\u2019s third largest.\nIn July, offshore institutions net purchased bonds for 8.84 billion US dollars (equivalent to 62 billion renminbi). Foreign investors now hold 2.25 percent of onshore bonds.\nJerry Li, Head of Greater China Local Markets, said: \u201cWe have actively marketed the China onshore bond market to foreign institutional investors, promoting this year\u2019s global index inclusion and our onshore capabilities to help global investors access this enormous market.\u201d\n\u201cRanking No. 1 for onshore bond trading volumes shows we have achieved significant momentum in renminbi markets, which we will continue to build on,\u201d Li added.\nSince the Bond Connect scheme was launched two years ago, more and more foreign investors are joining. In July, 96 new accounts were added, taking the total number of foreign institutional investors to 1,134 by the end of the month.\n\u201cWe expect foreign inflows into renminbi-denominated bonds to continue to rise in the coming months on the back of further renminbi bond index inclusion decisions and continued opening up measurements. Our analysts forecast an additional 120 billion US dollars to flow into onshore bonds in the next few years,\u201d Li concluded.",
