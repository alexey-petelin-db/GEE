The Government, through CESCE, offers support programmes for the internationalisation of Spanish companies through credit insurance coverage to financial institutions, as well as the possibility of setting long-term interest rates, which improves the competitiveness of technical, economic and financial offers of Spanish companies.\nThe new maternity hospital will be situated in the southeast area of C\u00f3rdoba, serving an area with a population of more than 600,000.
