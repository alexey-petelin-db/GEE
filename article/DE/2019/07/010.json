    "body": "This week Deutsche Bank celebrates its 50th anniversary in Indonesia, and reaffirms its commitment to the strong partnerships built over half a century with clients, community partners, and other stakeholders.\nDeutsche Bank first opened its doors in Jakarta in 1969, and has since played an active role in the economic and financial liberalisation in Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy through its corporate and investment bank.\nDeutsche Bank Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer and Member of the Management Board, Mr Werner Steinmueller said: \u201cWe are proud of what we have contributed to Indonesia over the past 50 years, and we are absolutely committed to this important and growing market.\u201d\nIn the late 1990s Deutsche Bank was a key advisor on banking sector consolidation after the Asian currency crisis, and today it helps Indonesia corporates and institutions access international capital markets and connect with international investors. In 2002 the bank was instrumental in the Republic of Indonesia\u2019s first public local currency bond issue and today it is one of the top primary dealers for government bonds.\nAs part of the bank\u2019s 50th anniversary celebrations, twenty volunteers from Deutsche Bank offices around Asia Pacific recently visited Jakarta to volunteer with the community. The initiative was part of the bank\u2019s corporate social responsibility Born to Be initiative, which uses education-led programmes to unlock the potential of the next generation.\nSix different nationalities from the bank\u2019s branches across India, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam, joined their local colleagues in Jakarta for a volunteering experience, spending time with the Happy Hearts Indonesia Foundation (HHI), Yayasan Kampuas Diakoneia (KDM), and Yayasan Karya Salemba Empat (KSE).\nDeutsche Bank Indonesia\u2019s Chief Country Officer Siantoro Goeyardi said: \u201cOver decades we have built strong long-term partnerships in the business community, and made a significant positive impact in the wider community.\n\u201cThis volunteering trip celebrates the Jakarta community of which we are an active part, supporting our partners to help children become the person they were born to be,\u201d Goeyardi said.\nOver three days, Deutsche Bank volunteers rolled up their sleeves to work with Happy Hearts Indonesia in the expansion of a special needs school and conducted a Special Olympics Games event, refurbished a children\u2019s dormitory at KDM and accompanied children from KSE on an Amazing Race event at the National Library to discover the joy of reading.\nOne of Deutsche Bank\u2019s regional volunteers Mercy Gandi said: \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to spend time with these amazing young people, and I\u2019m very proud of the positive impact the bank has made in the community.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank Asia Foundation (DBAF) is also funding 50 scholars through KSE\u2019s higher education programme, as part of its 50th anniversary celebrations in Indonesia. Since 2004, DBAF has contributed more than \u20ac1.4 million to community programmes and relief efforts in Indonesia.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Indonesia branch was established in 1969, and today operates as a corporate bank and investment bank where it ranks number one for institutional cash management for Euro clearing and number two for custody services.\nThe investment bank helps Indonesia clients access international markets, leading a number of landmark transactions across equity and debt capital markets. The bank led the Republic of Indonesia\u2019s first Euro bond in 2014 and the first US SEC Registered bond in 2017, among others. As a frequent corporate debt arranger, the bank also led Indonesia\u2019s first ever corporate green bond and first ever Komodo bond.\nFor further information, please contact:\nDeutsche Bank AG\nMedia Relations\nSarah Stabler\nPhone: +65 6423 8413\nEmail: sarah.stabler@db.com \nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides commercial and investment banking, retail banking, transaction banking and asset and wealth management products and services to corporations, governments, institutional investors, small and medium-sized businesses, and private individuals.
