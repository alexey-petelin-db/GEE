    "body": "Deutsche Bank\u2019s managed account platform, dbSelect, recently received HFM Europe\u2019s \u201cBest Managed Account Platform\u201d award.\nThe award from the hedge fund research and consulting firm recognizes managed account platforms which have excelled in the service they have provided their hedge fund clients over the past 12 months.\nLaunched in 2004, dbSelect connects investors with hedge fund managers. With more than 85 strategies to choose from, dbSelect is a cash-efficient, flexible way for connecting investors to hedge fund managers. The platform provides exposure to FX, CTA, Commodity, Macro, Risk Premia, Equity L/S and Market Neutral strategies.\n\u201cWe can offer highly customized solutions, beyond what most managers could provide themselves to their investors, something that very few banks have the capability of doing. Typical use cases involve international distribution capabilities, bespoke derivative access, leverage, or just simplified access to a basket of active managers. dbSelect both enhances the manager\u2019s capabilities and makes allocating to hedge funds easier and more flexible for investors,\u201d said Devin Anderson, US Head of Solutions Sales & Structuring.\nA short animated video introduces dbSelect to new clients. The video focuses on the platform\u2019s differentiation from other products on the market.\nContact us.",
