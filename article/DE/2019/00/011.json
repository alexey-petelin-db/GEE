    "title": "Statement on UK Parliament Brexit Vote",
    "body": "The UK Parliament today voted against the provisional withdrawal agreement between the UK and the European Union on the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\nFurther political debate will take place in the UK in the days ahead. If no agreement is approved before March 29, 2019, this could result in the UK leaving the European Union on that date without a transition period.\nWe believe it is in the interests of the UK and the EU to avoid the disruption of a no-deal Brexit.\nHowever, we are prepared for all eventualities. We began planning for Brexit in 2016 and our plans have always assumed the risk of a no-deal.",
