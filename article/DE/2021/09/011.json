    "body": "Deutsche Bank has been named \u2018Investment Bank of the Year for Western Europe\u2019 in The Banker Investment Banking Awards 2021.\n\u201cA clear story of turnaround, Deutsche Bank is able to evidence a strong performance across its investment bank including in M&A, ESG bonds and notably in ECM,\u201d the independent judging panel explained. The turnaround has \u201cenabled itself to be more focused and prioritise areas where it can really add value for clients\u201d.\nHenrik Johnsson, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Co-head of Investment Banking EMEA, said: \u201cSince the bank\u2019s radical restructuring, our new model - which focuses on our core strengths and puts corporate and institutional relationships at the heart of the Investment Bank - has been vindicated, with the business not merely meeting the targets set out in the summer of 2019, but exceeding them.\u201d\nThe bank\u2019s Equity Capital Markets (ECM) business was notably praised by the judges: \u201cIn European ECM, Deutsche Bank has improved its market position and worked on several important deals.\u201d On its Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) business, the judges said: \u201cThe bank has underscored its continued commitment to the M&A market by advising on a series of landmark deals for long-term corporate clients across several jurisdictions and sectors.\u201d\nBerthold Fuerst, Global Co-head of M&A at Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cThis prestigious accolade is a testament to the team\u2019s hard work. Deutsche Bank has emerged as a clear industry leader in a number of market segments in a highly competitive environment. Solid growth in debt origination, a rebound in LDCM and a strong showing in equity origination, contributed to our Origination & Advisory revenues increasing 34% in 2020.\u201d\nAlso singled out for praise was the bank\u2019s commitment to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) sector, evidenced by its establishment of a new sustainable finance unit last year. \u201cIt has already been making a noticeable impact and is fast becoming a go-to issuer for corporates and sovereigns, supranational and agency issuers for sustainable bonds,\u201d the judges said.\nThe Banker\u2019s Investment Banking Awards recognise the banks that are \u201cputting sustainability at the heart of what they do, have gone above and beyond to provide excellent service and execution for their clients \u2013 even during the most challenging of circumstances \u2013 and that have introduced impactful innovation into their work\u201d. The winners were decided by an independent judging panel, including representatives from The Banker, law firm Linklaters and the data providers Dealogic and Refinitiv.\nPlease read the full article from The Banker (paywall).",
