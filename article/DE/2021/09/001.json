We are focused on driving efficiencies while maintaining strong controls, and we are confident of achieving Deutsche Bank\u2019s 2022 targets.\nChristian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer\nDeutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today reported a 15% year on year rise in pre-tax profit to \u20ac 554 million in the third quarter of 2021 after recognising a further \u20ac 583 million in transformation charges. Adjusted profit before tax(1), which excludes transformation-related effects and specific revenue items, rose 39% year on year to \u20ac 1.2 billion and net income in the quarter rose 6% year on year to \u20ac 329 million.\nTransformation charges recognised in the quarter consisted predominantly of technology-related items, including approximately \u20ac 450 million relating to a contract settlement and software impairments, principally triggered by the bank\u2019s migration to the cloud.\n90% of the total transformation-related effects anticipated through year-end 2022 are now fully recognised. Deutsche Bank reaffirmed its intention to recognise most of the remaining transformation-related effects by year-end 2021.\nThird quarter profit before tax and adjusted profit before tax1 include an impact of \u20ac 98 million, predominantly in foregone revenues, from the ruling in April 2021 by the German Federal Court of Justice (\u2018BGH ruling\u2019) requiring active customer consent for pricing changes on current accounts. This impact is expected to be considerably lower from the fourth quarter of 2021 onwards, as approximately two-thirds of the accounts affected now have the necessary consent agreements in place. These will become effective in the fourth quarter. \nFor the first nine months of 2021, profit before tax was \u20ac 3.3 billion, despite \u20ac 798 million in transformation charges and \u20ac 324 million relating to the BGH ruling. The year-to-date impact of the BGH ruling comprised \u20ac 192 million in foregone revenues and \u20ac 131 million in litigation provisions. In the first nine months of 2020, profit before tax was \u20ac 846 million after \u20ac 283 million in transformation charges. Adjusted profit before tax(1), which excludes transformation-related effects and specific revenue items but includes the impact of the BGH ruling, was \u20ac4.3 billion, up from \u20ac 1.5 billion in the prior year period.\nNet income was \u20ac 2.2 billion in the first nine months, up more than five-fold from \u20ac 435 million in the prior year period. Post-tax return on average shareholders\u2019 equity was 4.3%, up from 0.1% in the same period of 2020, while post-tax return on average tangible equity (RoTE)\u00b9 was 4.8%, up from 0.2% in the prior year period. Adjusted post-tax RoTE\u00b9 was 6.6%\nThe four core businesses contributed to growth in nine-month post-tax RoTE as follows:\nCorporate Bank: 7.0%, up from 3.2% year on year;\nInvestment Bank: 13.5%, up from 10.6%;\nPrivate Bank: 2.7%, up from negative 1.8%;\nAsset Management: 28.3%, up from 20.3%.\nGroup cost/income ratio was 82%, down from 87% in the first nine months of 2020.\nCore Bank: profit up 64% in the first nine months of 2021\nIn the Core Bank, which excludes the Capital Release Unit, profit before tax was \u20ac 898 million in the third quarter, in line with \u20ac 909 million in the third quarter of 2020, despite \u20ac 570 million in transformation charges, up from \u20ac 66 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted profit before tax1 was up 23% year on year to \u20ac 1.5 billion. Post-tax RoTE\u00b9 was 3.9% in the quarter, while adjusted post-tax RoTE\u00b9 was 7.3%.\nFor the first nine months, Core Bank profit before tax rose 64% year on year to \u20ac 4.3 billion and adjusted profit before tax1 was \u20ac 5.2 billion, also up 64%. Post-tax RoTE was 7.5%, up from 4.3% in the prior year period, compared to the Core Bank\u2019s 2022 reported post-tax RoTE target of above 9%. Adjusted post-tax RoTE was 9.4%.\nCapital Release Unit: continued bottom line improvement and portfolio reduction\nThe Capital Release Unit reported a loss before tax of \u20ac 344 million in the quarter, a loss reduction of 19% versus the third quarter of 2020. This improvement was driven primarily by a 19% reduction in noninterest expenses to \u20ac 312 million.\nThe Capital Release Unit maintained progress on portfolio reduction during the third quarter. Leverage exposure was reduced from \u20ac 71 billion to \u20ac 61 billion, primarily driven by continued portfolio reduction actions and transfers of Prime Finance client relationships. Deutsche Bank aims to meet or exceed its year-end 2022 leverage exposure reduction target of \u20ac 51 billion by year-end 2021. RWAs were further reduced to \u20ac 30 billion, already ahead of the year-end 2022 target of \u20ac 32 billion.\nIn the first nine months, the Capital Release Unit reported a loss before tax of \u20ac 1.0 billion, a loss reduction of 43% versus the \u20ac 1.8 billion loss in the first nine months of 2020. This improvement was driven largely by a 32% reduction in noninterest expenses to \u20ac 1.1 billion, and a 37% year on year reduction in adjusted costs ex-transformation charges to \u20ac 901 million, down from \u20ac 1.4 billion the first nine months of 2020.\nSince the third quarter of 2020, the Unit has reduced leverage exposure by 32% from \u20ac 90 billion to \u20ac 61 billion, and RWAs by 23% from \u20ac 39 billion to \u20ac 30 billion.\nRevenues: resilience in core businesses\nGroup net revenues were \u20ac 6.0 billion in the third quarter, up 2% year on year despite continued normalising markets, low interest rates and \u20ac 96 million in foregone revenues from the BGH ruling.  Core Bank net revenues were \u20ac 6.1 billion, up 2%.\nFor the first nine months, Group net revenues were \u20ac 19.5 billion, up 5%, and Core Bank net revenues were also \u20ac 19.5 billion, up 4%.\nThird quarter revenue development in Deutsche Bank\u2019s core businesses was as follows:\nCorporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 1.3 billion, stable year on year. Business growth and deposit re-pricing offset interest rate headwinds and a year on year decline of \u20ac 59 million in items episodic in nature which comprise portfolio rebalancing actions, recoveries related to credit protection and other one-time effects. Excluding episodic items, revenues were up slightly, and no specific items affected revenues in the period. By quarter end, accounts with deposits of \u20ac 94 billion were covered by charging agreements, up from \u20ac 88 billion in the second quarter, and contributing \u20ac 96 million in quarterly net revenues. Loan growth was \u20ac 3 billion in the quarter. Nine-month net revenues were \u20ac 3.8 billion, down 3% year on year and essentially flat excluding items episodic in nature and currency translation effects.\nInvestment Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.2 billion, down 6% year on year. Revenues in Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) were down 12% at \u20ac 1.6 billion. Significantly higher revenues in Financing were offset by declines in Credit, Rates and Foreign Exchange revenues as solid levels of client activity were more than offset by normalising market conditions and lower volatility. Emerging Market revenues were higher, driven by performance across regions. Origination & Advisory revenues were up 22% year on year at \u20ac 648 million, reflecting growth across Debt Origination, Equity Origination and Advisory. Nine-month net revenues were \u20ac 7.7 billion, up 4% year on year. For the first nine months, Deutsche Bank ranked No. 1 in Origination & Advisory in Germany with a share of 8.7% (source: Dealogic). Deutsche Bank was named Best Investment Bank in Western Europe by The Banker magazine in its 2021 Investment Banking Awards.\nPrivate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.0 billion, down 2% year on year. Revenues were stable excluding specific items and \u20ac 94 million in foregone revenues arising from the BGH ruling. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany were down 6%, and up 1% if adjusted for the impact of the BGH ruling, while revenues in the International Private Bank were up 6%, and up 1% excluding specific items. New business volumes were \u20ac 9 billion, including \u20ac 5 billion in net inflows of investment products and \u20ac 3 billion in net new client loans. Nine-month net revenues were \u20ac 6.2 billion, up 1% year on year, despite a \u20ac 188 million impact from the BGH ruling. Year to date new business volumes were \u20ac 38 billion, above the Private Bank\u2019s full-year 2021 target of \u20ac 30 billion, including net inflows of investment products of \u20ac 22 billion and net new client loans of \u20ac 11 billion.\nAsset Management net revenues were \u20ac 656 million, up 17% year on year and the highest for seven quarters, driven primarily by a rise in management fees to the highest level for over six years. This was driven by six consecutive quarters of net inflows and market performance in a supportive market environment. Net inflows were \u20ac 12 billion, reflecting contributions across all asset pillars, and included \u20ac 5 billion in environmental, social and governance (ESG) assets, the highest quarterly ESG inflows of 2021 to date. Net inflows, together with a positive impact from currency movements, drove assets under management up by \u20ac 21 billion to a record \u20ac 880 billion. Since the third quarter of 2020, assets under management have grown by \u20ac 121 billion including net inflows of \u20ac 46 billion. For the first nine months, net revenues were up 18% to \u20ac 1.9 billion while net inflows were \u20ac 33 billion, including ESG net inflows of \u20ac 13 billion.\nFurther progress toward completing recognition of transformation charges\nNoninterest expenses rose 4% to \u20ac 5.4 billion in the quarter, including \u20ac 583 million in transformation charges. These were driven primarily by a contract settlement and software impairments, principally triggered by Deutsche Bank\u2019s migration to the cloud. Both of these are expected to reduce run-rate costs in future quarters. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges were down 3% to \u20ac 4.7 billion in the quarter.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s workforce was 84,512 full-time equivalents (FTEs) at the end of the quarter, up by 715 versus the second quarter. Selective hiring to support business growth and internalisation of contract staff were largely offset by workforce reduction measures and other departures, while the quarter-on-quarter FTE increase predominantly reflected the annual arrival of new graduate hires during the quarter. Since the end of the prior year period, the workforce has been reduced by just under 2,500 full-time equivalents despite selective hiring, internalisations and graduate hires.\nFor the first nine months, noninterest expenses were \u20ac 15.9 billion, down 2% despite a near-threefold year on year increase in transformation charges to \u20ac 798 million. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges were \u20ac 14.6 billion, down 4% year on year.\nCredit provisions remain significantly below prior year\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 117 million in the quarter, down 57% year on year, reflecting a supportive credit environment, high quality loan book and strict risk discipline. Provision for non-performing loans (stage 3) was \u20ac 199 million, down 51% year on year. This was partly offset by net releases of \u20ac 82 million of provision for performing loans (stage 1 and 2) driven by a more stable macro-economic outlook.\nFor the first nine months, provision for credit losses was down 83% year on year to \u20ac 261 million, or 8 basis points of average loans on an annualised basis, down from 47 basis points in the first nine months of 2020.\nConservative capital and balance sheet management\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.0% at the end of the quarter, in line with previous guidance, down from 13.2% at the end of the second quarter. This development mainly reflects higher RWAs due to methodology changes driven by regulation, as expected, together with RWA increases related to client-related activity. The latter were largely offset by a reduction in Operational Risk RWAs arising from improvements in the bank\u2019s risk profile. As at the end of the third quarter, CET1 capital reflected deductions for common share dividends of \u20ac 641 million.\nThe Leverage Ratio (fully loaded) remained stable at 4.8% in the quarter, reflecting continued progress on leverage exposure reduction in the Capital Release Unit offset by currency translation effects. On a phase-in basis, the leverage ratio was 4.9%.\nLiquidity reserves were \u20ac 249 billion in the quarter, versus \u20ac 254 billion at the end of the previous quarter, including High Quality Liquid Assets of \u20ac 217 billion. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 137%, above the bank\u2019s target of 130%, and preliminary Net Stable Funding Ratio was 123% in the quarter, above the bank\u2019s target range of 115-120% and with a surplus of \u20ac 109 billion above required levels.\nSustainable Finance: full year 2021 target exceeded after \u20ac 27 billion in third quarter volumes\nCumulative environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related financing and investment volumes reached \u20ac 125 billion excluding DWS since the beginning of 2020. This exceeds Deutsche Bank\u2019s target of at least \u20ac 100 billion by year-end 2021, on a path to the bank\u2019s target of at least \u20ac 200 billion by year-end 2023.\nThird-quarter ESG-related financing and investment volumes were \u20ac 27 billion excluding DWS, in line with the record levels of the previous quarter. The bank\u2019s businesses contributed as follows:\nCorporate Bank: \u20ac 3 billion in sustainable financing, raising the Corporate Bank\u2019s cumulative total to \u20ac 18 billion;\nInvestment Bank: \u20ac 17 billion in sustainable financing and capital market issuance, bringing the Investment Bank\u2019s cumulative total to \u20ac 73 billion. In 2021 to date, Deutsche Bank ranked top-five globally in ESG-related debt and sustainability-linked bond issuance as measured by fees, up from 8th in the full year 2020 (Source: Dealogic);\nPrivate Bank: \u20ac 5 billion growth in ESG assets under management and a further \u20ac 1 billion in new client lending, raising the business\u2019s cumulative total to \u20ac 34 billion.\nProgress in the businesses during the quarter included:\nActing as bookrunner on four of the six largest ESG bond issues of the quarter as measured by face value (source: Dealogic);\nLeading three inaugural sovereign green bonds, notably a \u00a3 10 billion issue for the UK Debt Management Office, a \u20ac 5 billion inaugural green bond for the Kingdom of Spain;\nExecuting the bank\u2019s first green repurchase agreement, raising \u00a3 20 million;\nRaising $ 200 million through the bank\u2019s first green Formosa Bond, which will help fund renewable energy projects and energy efficiency improvements;\nThe Corporate Bank further expanded its offering for the German Mittelstand and built out its capability to structure sustainability-linked loans in this segment.\nThe Private Bank Germany introduced Blue Economy funds to build resilience in regions most vulnerable to ocean risk.\nDeutsche Bank underwent a \u201cSustainable Procurement Maturity Review\u201d for the first time by EcoVadis, and was rated \u201cproactive\u201d. The bank also defined a path to 100% renewable electricity usage for its own operations by 2024 via the use of Energy Attribute Certificates.\nCumulative ESG volumes include sustainable financing (flow) and investments (stock) in the Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Private Bank from January 1 2020 to date, as set forth in Deutsche Bank\u2019s Sustainability Deep Dive of May 20, 2021. Products in scope include capital market issuance (bookrunner share only), sustainable financing and period-end assets under management. Cumulative volumes and targets do not include ESG assets under management within DWS, which are reported separately by DWS.\nRead the full media release in the\nPDF\ndownloadable PDF.\nAnalyst call\nAn analyst call to discuss third quarter 2021 financial results will take place at 13:00 CEST today.
