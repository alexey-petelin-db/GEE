    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) today announced the appointment of James von Moltke as Chair of the Working Group on Euro-Risk Free Reference Rates (EUR RFR WG).\nThe Working Group is responsible for advancing the adoption of Risk Free Reference Rates in the euro area. This follows the Financial Stability Board\u2019s assessment that financial markets\u2019 reliance on LIBOR poses clear risks to global financial stability. The Working Group\u2019s responsibilities include promoting the widespread transition from the LIBORs across a range of financial products and identifying potential impediments to the widespread adoption of the euro short-term rate  (\u20acSTR).\nMoltke\u2019s first meeting as Chair of the Working Group will be on 1st July 2021. He takes over from ING\u2019s Tanate Phutrakul following the conclusion of the EUR RFR WG\u2019s initial mandate, which culminated in a number of recommendations on euro area benchmark transition and reform.\nJames von Moltke said: \u201cA smooth transition from IBOR to risk-free rates is vital for the financial services sector, for the clients we serve, and for investors around the world. I am honoured to take on this role. I look forward to building on the progress made under Tanate\u2019s leadership, and working with our partners across Europe\u2019s financial and regulatory landscape to help the industry move efficiently to alternative risk free rates.\u201d \nDeutsche Bank has been actively engaged in IBOR transition for a number of years. In 2017, it set up a dedicated IBOR Transition Programme to develop and execute its plan to transition to alternative risk free reference rates and coordinate engagement with clients.",
