    "title": "Merkel: \u201cWorking together to revitalise Germany\u201d",
    "body": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel underscored the important role of the financial sector in the fight against the Covid pandemic at Deutsche Bank's first ever virtual New Year's reception, which attracted more than 7,000 clients, friends and employees of Deutsche Bank. In a video greeting Merkel said, \u201cAlong with state aid, support from the financial sector has been extremely important. Our export-oriented economy needs appropriate regional and international financial services\u201d, she continued, adding that a crisis-proof and competitive financial sector is fundamentally important for the national economy.\nMerkel said that she was, of course, aware of the challenges facing the banking industry, but she is confident that, together, policymakers and businesses will succeed in quickly restoring Germany's innovative strength and helping the nation return to strong growth rates after the pandemic.\nIn his speech, Christian Sewing emphasised that he took the Chancellor's entreaty very seriously. \u201cWe at Deutsche Bank promise you that we will continue playing our part in ensuring that people and companies make it through this challenging period as unscathed as possible \u2013 and that in some respects Germany can emerge from the crisis in even better shape, if we lay the right foundations now,\u201d said the CEO. \u201cEspecially now, in this phase of upheaval, we want to continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with our clients\u201d, he added. \u201cDuring challenging times especially, there is a huge need for action and consultation. The same is true of politicians with whom we are in ongoing dialogue, which we also wish to maintain.\u201d\nIn a conversation with Sewing moderated by our Global Head of Communications & CSR J\u00f6rg Eigendorf, German Minister for Economic Affairs Peter Altmaier said the Covid pandemic is making great demands of citizens, companies and politicians. \u201cWe must make sure that today's loosened restrictions are not followed in four weeks by the next lockdown,\u201d he said, referring to recent decisions by the federal and state governments regarding lockdown restrictions. \u201cThe consensus is greater than it was in November\u201d, he added. Altmaier, who joined the event via video from Berlin also praised the successful restructuring of Deutsche Bank, saying, \u201cWe need a strong international bank. I would like to thank Deutsche Bank for putting itself through an extensive course of restructuring \u2013 it has strengthened trust. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re successful.\u201d\nAt the start of the event, President Karl von Rohr underscored the progress the bank has made along its transformation path. \u201cThe past year has been an exhausting time for us, but also one in which \u2013 I believe \u2013 we were able to prove once again how relevant we are.\u201d According to surveys, customer confidence in Deutsche Bank in Germany is higher than it has been in eight years. \u201dAbove all,\u201d von Rohr said \u201cthat's praise for our employees\u201d.\nIn keeping with the fact that many clients especially value Deutsche Bank's global perspective, Management Board members Christiana Riley, CEO Americas, and Alexander von zur M\u00fchlen, CEO Asia Pacific, offered insights into their regions in a conversation with Anke Hallmann, Deputy Head of Communications & CSR. \u201cEven though we are happy about Joe Biden's election, we have to understand that the new US president will first and foremost be concerned with the tense domestic political situation,\u201d said Riley. Alexander von zur M\u00fchlen said he expected more diplomatic skill in international trade policy again. Still, he added, relations between the United States and China are likely to remain tense for years to come. \u201cEurope must find its own inclusive approach somewhere in between,\u201d he advised.\nBChancellor Merkel also took the New Year's reception as an opportunity to congratulate Deutsche Bank on its 151st anniversary, after last year's 150 years anniversary celebration had to be cancelled. \u201cDeutsche Bank has endured and survived all the upheavals of recent German history. That is cause for optimism\u201d, she said. \u201cIn this spirit, I wish Deutsche Bank a bright future.\u201d\nClick here for a full-length recording of the virtual New Year's reception.
