    "title": "S&P upgrades Deutsche Bank\u2019s Issuer Credit Rating from BBB+ to A-",
    "body": "S&P Global Ratings (Standard & Poor\u2019s) has upgraded several of Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings, including the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating and Senior Preferred Debt Rating, from BBB+ to A-, outlook stable. The Issuer Credit Rating is an important benchmark of credit quality for clients and other counterparties who trade with the bank. Deutsche Bank\u2019s counterparty ratings are now in \u2018A\u2019 territory with all leading rating agencies.\nS&P commented: \u201cDeutsche Bank\u2019s transformation program is delivering tangible benefits. The upgrade indicates that the operational restructuring launched in 2019 is transforming Deutsche Bank into a more profitable, more focused and better-controlled group.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging to see our progress on Deutsche Bank\u2019s transformation recognised, once again, by a leading rating agency,\u201d said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThese upgrades reflect that our strategy is the right one and that we are executing well. Importantly, they also enable us do more business with our clients.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a significant milestone on our transformation journey,\u201d added James von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer. \u201cOur re-focused business model is delivering improved profitability with tight risk and balance sheet management. These upgrades support us on the path toward our 2022 targets.\u201d\nS&P\u2019s action represents the third ratings upgrade from a leading rating agency in recent months. Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings were upgraded by Moody\u2019s in August and by Fitch in September. \nDrivers of these upgrades, in S&P\u2019s own words\nQuality of both strategy and execution. S&P commented: \u201cThe transformation program is more decisive than previous editions in addressing Deutsche Bank's competitive weaknesses: excessive costs and too many underperforming business units.\u201d The agency added: \u201cFurthermore, we see greater rigor in senior management's execution of the plan, and the bank is achieving its milestones as it works toward its 2022 financial targets. This has positive implications for franchise stability and the predictability and sustainability of earnings.\u201d\nRevenue resilience despite restructuring and interest rate headwinds. S&P noted: \u201cDespite its restructuring, Deutsche Bank has been able to leverage favorable market conditions to grow revenue. In particular, it has benefited from buoyant capital markets activity in recent quarters. This demonstrates the continued strength of its investment bank franchise and mitigates margin pressure from prolonged negative euro interest rates.\u201d\nPositioned for continued earnings growth. The agency believes Deutsche Bank is well placed to benefit from both internal and environmental factors: \u201cWe expect that Deutsche Bank's earnings will improve further in 2022 as transformation charges fall away, operating costs decline, and the CRU winds down. Interest rate headwinds are also easing thanks to deposit repricing, rising long-term euro rates, and loan growth.\u201d\nA solid risk profile. S&P described Deutsche Bank\u2019s risk management as a contributor to their decision: \u201cWe think Deutsche Bank has a good track record in financial risk management, and its credit exposures are well-diversified and significantly collateralized.\u201d\nCost discipline does not prevent key investments. S&P noted that, the bank\u2019s cost discipline has not diluted our commitment to continued control and technology investment. The agency said: \u201cImportantly, Deutsche Bank's focus on cost efficiency does not appear to have squeezed necessary investments in internal control remediation, including its anti-financial-crime framework.\u201d S&P added: \u201cthe bank's ongoing technology investments are crucial to its medium-term ability to remain competitive.\u201d\nCapital and liquidity strength. For S&P, Deutsche Bank\u2019s conservative balance sheet management has delivered results. The agency noted: \u201cDeutsche Bank maintains sound capital, bail-in buffers, and liquidity. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.0% at Sept. 30, 2021, and we expect it will remain about that level. Deutsche Bank's liquidity and funding profiles remain solid, in our view.\u201d\nAn overview of Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings with leading agencies, including the upgrades announced by S&P, is as follows:",
