    "title": "Minority, Women and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Broker Dealers help to underwrite Deutsche Bank\u2019s 750 million US dollar bond",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank today successfully closed its offering of 750 million US dollars of its senior non-preferred callable four-year (4nc3) Fixed-to-Floating rate bonds. For the first time, 11 additional underwriters owned and led by management teams from minority, woman and service-disabled veteran backgrounds joined Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to underwrite this bond offering.\nEach Joint Lead Manager will retain 7% of the fees.  The full group of minority, woman and service-disabled veteran owned firms will collectively receive around 60% of the fees associated with this transaction. This marks a significant increase over the traditional fee arrangement for other sole-led bank transactions, where such firms typically retain 0.5-1% individually and 3-5% collectively.\n\u201cThis is an impactful statement to the financial community,\u201d said David R. Jones, President & CEO, CastleOak Securities, L.P. \u201cDiversity and inclusion have increasingly become a topic of discussion, but it\u2019s great to be recognized for our capabilities and execution prowess rather than as a participant merely to check a box.\u201d \n\u201cHaving Loop Capital Markets participate as an active joint bookrunner with books, allowed us to fully leverage our distribution capabilities and amplifies our discussions with investors,\u201d said Sidney Dillard, Partner, Head of Corporate & Investment Banking at Loop Capital.\n\u201cTwo of the most exciting developments in the diversity and inclusion (D&I) space over the past year have been the broadening of corporate engagement with D&I broker dealers and the elevation of roles being offered,\u201d said Annie Seelaus, CEO, R Seelaus & Co. \u201cDeutsche Bank\u2019s initiative to elevate their D&I partners to active book-running roles goes far beyond bestowing a credential. Allowing us to participate in every aspect of the new issue process creates the kind of institutional knowledge that can only be earned one way \u2013 with experience and repetition.\u201d    \n\u201cThis deal will lead directly to more veteran hires here as we continue to execute on our commitment to mentor, hire, and train veterans,\u201d said Chance Mims, Founder & CEO Academy Securities.\n \u201cToday\u2019s brand of a much higher level of engagement leads to greater profitability, introduces a more diverse network of high quality investors to an issuer\u2019s portfolio while promoting better business outcomes for all stakeholders, including clients. Issuers take note \u2013 you will achieve all that and more by deepening your partnerships with firms owned by minorities, women and disabled veterans,\u201d said Ronald M. Quigley, Head of Fixed Income Syndicate at Mischler Financial Group, Inc.\n\u201cWhile Diversity and Inclusion initiatives have been in place for decades, our invitation to join Deutsche Bank as an active joint bookrunner on this offering is a reflection of their confidence in our ability to add value as a partner and creates a foundation for us to continue to build our presence as an underwriter. Our role on this mandate demonstrates a deliberate step forward in diversity and inclusion initiatives and we are pleased with the successful execution of the transaction,\" said Christopher J. Williams, Chairman, Siebert Williams Shank & Co., LLC.\nThe offering reflects Deutsche Bank\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion, both among its employees and in the wider community. As part of this commitment, the bank seeks to expand community partnerships and work with diverse suppliers, vendors and other partners. Today\u2019s announcement reflects Deutsche Bank\u2019s strong partnerships, developed over many years, with these and similar firms on Wall Street.\nThe group of underwriters were selected to represent diverse missions including Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, African American Owned and Women Owned firms.\nThe full list is as follows: \nJoint Lead Managers\nAcademy Securities Inc. Service-Disabled Veteran Owned\nCastleOak Securities, L.P. African American Owned\nLoop Capital Markets LLC African American Owned\nMischler Financial Group, Inc Service-Disabled Veteran Owned\nR Seelaus & Co., Inc. Women Owned\nSiebert Williams Shank & Co., LLC Woman / African American Owned\nCo-Managers\nAmeriVet Securities, Inc. Service-Disabled Veteran Owned\nBancroft Capital LLC Service-Disabled Veteran Owned\nCapital Institutional Services, Inc. Women Owned\nMulti-Bank Securities, Inc. Service-Disabled Veteran Owned\nRoberts & Ryan Investments, Inc. Service-Disabled Veteran Owned\nThe Broker Dealers demonstrated their ability to execute a benchmark deal to Deutsche Bank\u2019s investor client base, who seek to support diversity and inclusion with respect to underwriters. The transaction is an important element of Deutsche Bank\u2019s wider commitment to diversity and inclusion, and the bank hopes to deliver at least one transaction with a similar underwriting group annually in the years ahead, working with a wide range of minority-owned Broker Dealers.\nThis offering enabled Deutsche Bank to share its capital markets experience, legal knowledge, and partnership and mentoring expertise with a highly diverse Syndicate group. This helps each firm gain further transaction experience and expand its opportunities to work with new investors.\n\u201cWe have offered these Joint Lead Managers the opportunity to play a full role in the deal execution by being involved in a real-time book build and interacting closely with the issuer,\u201d said Jeanmarie Genirs, Head of US IG Syndicate at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe process was seamless, and what\u2019s most gratifying is that the syndicate proved their capabilities to a wider client and investor base,\u201d she added.\nThe offering attracted total demand from investors of $1.8 billion US dollars, with final final demand approaching $1.1 billion dollars, pricing at 112.5 basis points over the .25% US Treasury maturing 3/15/25.\n\u201cWe were pleased to leverage Deutsche Bank\u2019s strong relationships with US investors to work with partners from diverse communities,\u201d said Dixit Joshi, Group Treasurer. \u201cPromoting greater diversity and inclusion in the finance industry reflects our wider commitment to sustainable finance.\u201d\nToday\u2019s announcement builds on existing efforts by Deutsche Bank in the United States to address racial inequities. Last year, Paul Trussell, senior Research Analyst and co-chair of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Black Leadership Forum, joined the Americas Executive Committee as the bank\u2019s Diversity Champion. In the summer of 2020, Deutsche Bank Americas committed to seven actions in seven months to advance the principles of diversity, equality and inclusiveness, which were completed ahead of schedule in December 2020.\nThis bond is Deutsche Bank\u2019s fifth issuance of 2021, across three currencies. The bank has already completed a significant portion of its 2021 issuance plan and was recently named \u201c2020 Financial Issuer of the Year\u201d by International Financing Review.\nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides retail and private banking, corporate and transaction banking, lending, asset and wealth management products and services as well as focused investment banking to private individuals, small and medium-sized companies, corporations, governments and institutional investors.
