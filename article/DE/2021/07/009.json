A further strengthening of our presence in the Italian market thanks to a network that excels in terms of expertise and presence on the territory. Valuable advisory is for us the key to the success of our business: the strong partnership with Deutsche Bank, which we have been working with for many years in Italy and globally, has allowed us to appreciate the value and expertise of its financial advisors, a landmark in the asset management sector. This acquisition is for us a significant step forward in a path of growth and continuous innovation and evolution of the business towards multi-channel model. Deutsche Bank's network of Financial Advisors will work in synergy with the already consolidated and strong network of Zurich\u2019s agents to offer the fullest possible range of distributive channels and the best solutions for financial and insurance planning.
