    "body": "Nigel Wilson, CEO, Legal & General and Jim Reid discuss how the future is in our own hands and that there are huge opportunities out there in new technologies and strategic investments that can overcome many of the secular negative forces we are all familiar with (debt, demographics, low productivity, etc.). However, Nigel believes we need to shed our old-fashioned attitude to the type of assets we invest in long-term and urges governments to provide the infrastructure and regulatory regime to make the future as bright as he thinks it can be.\nWhat they discuss:\nWhat\u2019s it like running a business during a pandemic when almost everyone has been working from home?\nWhat is the future of work?\nHow do big cities need to adapt post pandemic?\nWill a fourth technological revolution overpower secular problems such as debt, demographics, and low productivity?\nAre we seeing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for governments to borrow to invest?\nShould we be moving away more from traditional investments like government bonds and into more new economy and infrastructure projects?\nWhat is the future of green investment? Should the focus be on carbon capture or renewables?\nHow does Legal & General view ESG?\nModular housing \u2013 is it starting to gather momentum?\nIntergenerational divide \u2013 is housing and building more a way to fix that?\nIs there a bubble in tech valuations in the US at the moment?\nWere negative rates in Europe an error?\nWill London maintain its advantage in financial services post Brexit?",
