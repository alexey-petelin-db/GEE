    "title": "Deutsche Bank arranges Thailand\u2019s first onshore hedge under new NRQC rules",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) Thailand this week arranged the market\u2019s first onshore hedge for a foreign corporate under the Bank of Thailand\u2019s (BOT) new Non-Resident Qualified Company rules.\nDeutsche Bank acted fast and arranged the market\u2019s first transaction for a corporate client just three weeks after the BOT published new rules for Non-Resident Qualified Companies (NRQC) on January 5, 2021.\nThe new rules allow non-resident companies to access the onshore Thai Baht (THB) liquidity, without providing underlying documents for each transaction.\nDeutsche Bank Head of Global Markets, Thailand, Teerada Tuppun said: \u201cWe are pleased to be the first bank in Thailand to arrange the market\u2019s first non-resident onshore THB hedge. The solution provides our corporate clients access to more affordable and flexible THB hedging under the new NRQC rules.\nForeign corporates can save on hedging costs by accessing the onshore foreign exchange curve, because the onshore rates are generally cheaper than offshore hedging rates.\n\u201cWe expect the new NRQC rules to attract many more non-resident companies to hedge onshore, creating an entirely new market for our THB onshore franchise,\u201d Tuppun added.\nWith Thai Baht appreciating 10% from its peak in 2020, the cross currency rates and hedging costs became more volatile for foreign companies having THB exposure, at a time when companies are tightly managing costs for the Covid economic recovery.\nThe NRQC Scheme allows corporates with trade and direct investment in Thailand to access onshore THB liquidity with a greater flexibility, easily switching their hedge from the offshore curve to onshore curve, or vice versa without making any changes to their current hedge workflow.\nQualified non-Thai companies can register for NRQC status through Deutsche Bank AG, Bangkok Branch.\nFor further information please contact:\nDeutsche Bank AG Media Relations                                           \nSarah Stabler\nEmail: sarah.stabler@db.com\nPhone: +65 9116 9970\nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides retail and private banking, corporate and transaction banking, lending, asset and wealth management products and services as well as focused investment banking to private individuals, small and medium-sized companies, corporations, governments and institutional investors.
