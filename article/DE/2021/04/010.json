    "body": "Moody\u2019s Investors Service today placed all Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings on review for upgrade. A review for upgrade implies the possibility of a rating action within a shorter timeframe and is typically concluded within 30 to 90 days, according to the agency.\nMoody\u2019s states: \u201cthe review for upgrade takes account of Deutsche Bank\u2019s swift and pronounced progress towards its objective of achieving a more balanced and sustainable business model\u2026coupled with the bank\u2019s unchanged solid capital and liquidity buffers.\u201d\nJames von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, said: \u201cI am delighted and encouraged by this move from Moody\u2019s, which follows outlook upgrades from other rating agencies in recent months. We are steadily gaining recognition with these key stakeholders for the disciplined execution of our transformation strategy. Our priority now must be to maintain that discipline, and make further progress on our ratings.\u201d\nEarnings strength and strong balance sheet management: key factors in self-financing Deutsche Bank\u2019s transformation\nIn respect of disciplined execution of transformation, Moody\u2019s noted: \u201cSince Deutsche Bank announced its strategic overhaul in summer 2019, it has provided for almost \u20ac7 billion of restructuring and transformation charges and \u20ac1.8 billion in loan loss provisions.\u201d\nFor Moody\u2019s, Deutsche Bank\u2019s success in financing transformation from its own resources is a key factor. The agency added: \u201cDeutsche Bank\u2019s regained earnings strength; its reduced capital and leverage exposure consumption; as well as significantly lower operating costs, strong liquidity and reduced dependence on confidence-sensitive market funding have allowed it to self-finance its strategic overhaul without a significant impact on its key capital ratios.\u201d\nThe path to an upgrade: earnings momentum, strong risk management, and continued investment in technology and controls\nMoody\u2019s makes clear that sustainability of Investment Bank revenues in normalising markets will be important. As part of the review for upgrade, the agency \u201cwill assess the sustainability of the bank\u2019s most recent achievements in growing revenues and earnings, in particular its ability to maintain robust capital markets revenues in a less favourable market environment, without increasing its risk appetite.\u201d Moody\u2019s will also look for momentum in the Corporate Bank and Private Bank against the backdrop of interest rate headwinds.\nCredit quality, notably in focus industries, will be a factor. Moody\u2019s review \u201cwill focus on the magnitude of risk exposures within Deutsche Bank\u2019s generally well-diversified loan book, in particular exposures to sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, such as commercial real estate, aviation and leisure.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s made clear that for Deutsche Bank, continued execution is all-important, in particular, \u201cbeing able to sustain adequate profitability while continuing to invest to strengthen its technology platform and controls and risk management infrastructure.\u201d\nKey factors: sustainability leadership and digitalisation\nMoody\u2019s quoted two additional factors which will play a role in its upgrade review: digital transformation and sustainability. The agency made clear: \u201cMoody\u2019s will review the bank\u2019s \u2026 ambition in developing itself into a sustainability leader among its peers.\u201d Deutsche Bank will update stakeholders on the bank\u2019s sustainability strategy at its first \u2018Sustainability Deep Dive\u2019 on Thursday.

In November 2020, Moody\u2019s upgraded its ratings outlook for Deutsche Bank from negative to stable. In January, Fitch Ratings lifted its outlook by two notches, from negative to positive, while S&P made the same move in February. With this latest move, Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings outlook now stands at positive/review for upgrade with all three leading agencies.\nAn overview of Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings with leading rating agencies, updated for today\u2019s action, can be found here.",
