We have achieved our highest profit before tax in 16 years, delivered growth well ahead of target and maintained our focus on cost discipline while investing in key areas. Our strong capital generation enables us to accelerate distributions to shareholders. This gives us firm confidence that we will deliver on our 2025 targets.\nChristian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer\nDeutsche Bank (XETRA: DBGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today announced profit before tax of \u20ac 5.7 billion for the full year 2023, up 2% over 2022. Revenues grew by 6% to \u20ac 28.9 billion, and by 8% excluding specific items\u00b9. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac 21.7 billion, up 6%, with growth driven primarily by nonoperating costs\u00b9 of \u20ac 1.1 billion, up from \u20ac 474 million in 2022. Adjusted costs, which exclude these nonoperating items, rose 3% to \u20ac 20.6 billion, as savings from efficiency measures partly offset costs relating to investments. The cost/income ratio was 75% in 2023, stable compared to 2022.\nRaising distributions to shareholders\nDeutsche Bank plans to increase both share repurchases and dividends by at least 50% year on year in 2024. The bank has received supervisory approval for a further share repurchase of \u20ac 675 million, which it aims to complete in the first half of 2024, having completed \u20ac 450 million in share repurchases in 2023. The bank plans to recommend 2023 dividends of \u20ac 900 million, or \u20ac 0.45 per share, up from \u20ac 0.30 per share for 2022, at its Annual General Meeting in May 2024. Having raised its capital outlook by \u20ac 3 billion in October 2023, the bank is well positioned to exceed its capital distribution goal of \u20ac 8 billion in respect of the financial years 2021-25, paid in 2022-26. The bank today published updated guidance for a proposed dividend of \u20ac 1.00 per share for the financial year 2025, subject to delivery of financial targets and to a 50% payout ratio.\nJames von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, said: \u201cWe have reached an inflection point on key dimensions. We have delivered growth and capital strength while absorbing the twin impacts of continued investments and increased regulatory capital requirements. Looking ahead, with those impacts increasingly behind us, we are well positioned to accelerate our progress toward our 2025 goals.\u201d\nAccelerating execution of the Global Hausbank strategy: a clear path towards 2025 targets\nDeutsche Bank made further progress on accelerating execution of its Global Hausbank strategy on all dimensions during 2023:\nRevenue growth: Deutsche Bank has raised its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) target for the period 2021-2025 by two percentage points, from between 3.5% and 4.5% to between 5.5% and 6.5%, after substantially outperforming its original target in both 2022 and 2023. The bank aims to generate revenues of around \u20ac 32 billion in 2025. The bank has invested to drive growth in capital light businesses, notably in the Corporate Bank, Origination & Advisory and Wealth Management, adding relationship manager hires in these businesses. In addition, the bank completed the acquisition of Numis which, the bank believes, will accelerate this strategy in the UK. Assets under management grew by \u20ac 115 billion in 2023, which is expected to drive revenue growth in the Private Bank and Asset Management in future periods.\nOperational Efficiency: Deutsche Bank made further progress on its \u20ac 2.5 billion operational efficiency programme during 2023. As at year-end 2023, savings either realised or expected from completed efficiency measures grew to \u20ac 1.3 billion, with around \u20ac 900 million in savings realised to date including approximately \u20ac 350 million in 2023. The bank expects the programme\u2019s remaining savings of \u20ac 1.6 billion to be driven by measures relating to infrastructure and technology efficiencies, including application de-commissioning and operating model improvements; optimisation of the bank\u2019s platform in Germany; and front-to-back process redesign, including simplified workflows and automation. The vast majority of these measures are expected to be reflected in the adjusted cost run-rate in 2025. The measures are expected to lead to a reduction of approximately 3,500 roles, mainly in non-client-facing areas. The bank has set a goal for a quarterly run-rate of adjusted costs of \u20ac 5 billion and aims to operate with total costs of around \u20ac 20 billion in 2025.\nCapital efficiency: Deutsche Bank achieved risk weighted asset (RWA) reductions of \u20ac 13 billion by year-end 2023, around halfway toward its target for RWA efficiencies of \u20ac 25-30 billion by 2025. This included a further \u20ac 3 billion in reductions in the fourth quarter, primarily due to securitisation transactions. These measures, together with strong organic capital generation, enabled the bank to increase its CET1 ratio to 13.7% by year-end, from 13.4% at year-end 2022. Deutsche Bank today announces capital distributions of \u20ac 1.6 billion in the first half of 2024 and now expects to exceed its goal of \u20ac 8 billion in capital distributions to shareholders paid in 2022-26. Subject to achievement of its published financial targets and to a payout ratio of 50%, the bank today publishes updated guidance for a proposed dividend of \u20ac 1.00 per share in respect of the financial year 2025.\n2023 profit development reflects nonoperating items and strategy execution\nPost-tax profit was \u20ac 4.9 billion, down 14% year on year, reflecting an increase in income tax expense of \u20ac 851 million over 2022. In 2023, income tax expense included a positive year-end deferred tax asset (DTA) valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.0 billion, largely reflecting continuously strong performance in the UK, compared to a positive year-end DTA valuation adjustment of \u20ac 1.4 billion in 2022 which related to the bank\u2019s US operations. 2022 also benefited from the geographical mix of income.\nPost-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity (RoTE\u00b9) was 7.4%, compared to 9.4% in 2022. Post-tax return on average shareholders\u2019 equity (RoE1) was 6.7% compared to 8.4% in the prior year. The year-on-year development in both ratios partly reflects increased total equity due to organic capital generation and the higher income tax expense compared to 2022.\nFourth-quarter pre-tax profit was \u20ac 698 million, down 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-on-year development largely reflects nonoperating items related to strategy execution: impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets rose to \u20ac 233 million, up from \u20ac 68 million in 2022, due entirely to a goodwill impairment charge related to the acquisition of Numis. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2022 included a \u20ac 305 million gain on the sale of Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors in Italy.\nFourth-quarter net profit was \u20ac 1.4 billion, down 28% from the prior year quarter. The year-on-year development primarily reflects the aforementioned non-operating items and lower DTA valuation adjustment compared to the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter post-tax RoTE1 was 8.8% and post-tax RoE1 was 7.9%.\nRevenues: continued outperformance supports increased 2021-25 CAGR target\nNet revenues were \u20ac 28.9 billion in 2023, up 6% year on year, and up 8% if adjusted for specific items. These items included a prior year gain on the sale of Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors in Italy of \u20ac 305 million and \u20ac 125 million from workout activities related to Sal. Oppenheim in 2022, neither of which recurred in 2023. Both of these items arose in the Private Bank. Additionally, debt valuation adjustments (DVAs) in the Investment Bank had a \u20ac 47 million negative impact in 2023 versus a \u20ac 49 million benefit in 2022. Compound annual revenue growth since 2021 was 6.6%, well above the bank\u2019s original target of between 3.5% and 4.5% from 2021-2025. Fourth-quarter net revenues were \u20ac 6.7 billion, up 5% year on year and up 10% excluding specific items, predominantly the aforementioned gain on sale in the prior year quarter.\nCorporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 7.7 billion in 2023, up 22% year on year. All businesses delivered double-digit year-on-year growth, driven by strong net interest income and continued pricing discipline. Revenues in Corporate Treasury Services rose 14% to \u20ac 4.4 billion, Institutional Client Services revenues grew by 20% to \u20ac 1.9 billion, and Business Banking revenues grew 55% to \u20ac 1.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, Corporate Bank revenues were \u20ac 1.9 billion, up 9% year on year, reflecting a continued favorable interest rate environment and pricing discipline, supported by a solid deposit base and higher fee and commission income. Corporate Treasury Services revenues were up 2% to \u20ac 1.1 billion, while revenues in Institutional Client Services grew 12% to \u20ac 495 million and Business Banking revenues grew 25% to \u20ac 364 million.\nInvestment Bank net revenues were \u20ac 9.2 billion in 2023, down 9% year on year, or down 8% excluding the aforementioned DVA impacts. Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) revenues were \u20ac 8.0 billion, down 11% from an exceptionally strong prior year. Revenues in Foreign Exchange, Rates and Emerging Markets were substantially lower, reflecting reduced levels of volatility and market activity; this development was partly offset by strong growth in Credit Trading. Revenues in Origination & Advisory rose 25% year on year to \u20ac 1.2 billion, driven primarily by Debt Origination due to the non-recurrence of the prior year\u2019s mark to market losses in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. This more than offset a 38% decline in Advisory revenues which reflected very low levels of industry activity (source: Dealogic). In the fourth quarter, Investment Bank revenues were up 10% year on year. FIC revenues were \u20ac 1.5 billion, up 1% over the strong levels of the prior year quarter. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher, driven by Distressed and improvements to the flow business, while strong growth in Emerging Markets was driven by increased client activity in Asia. This was partly offset by lower revenues in Rates and Foreign Exchange compared to the high levels of the prior year quarter. Origination & Advisory revenues grew by 56% to \u20ac 305 million, driven by Debt Origination revenues, primarily reflecting improvements in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets which benefitted from a non-repeat of prior year hedge losses and a partial recovery in the industry fee pool (source: Dealogic).\nPrivate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 9.6 billion in 2023, up 5% year on year, and up 10% if adjusted for the aforementioned specific items booked in the International Private Bank. Higher revenues from deposit products, driven by higher net interest margins, more than offset lower commissions and fee income driven by contractual and regulatory changes and the non-recurrence of revenues from Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors after its divestment. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany rose 14% to \u20ac 6.1 billion, while revenues in the International Private Bank were down 8%, or up 3% excluding specific items. Assets under Management grew by \u20ac 40 billion to \u20ac 559 billion during the year, largely driven by net inflows of \u20ac 29 billion. In the fourth quarter, Private Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.4 billion, down 4% year on year, or up 9% ex-specific items. Private Bank Germany revenues grew 10% to \u20ac 1.5 billion, while revenues in the International Private Bank were \u20ac 907 million, down 21%, and up 8% ex-specific items. Assets under Management grew by \u20ac 12 billion during the quarter, driven mainly by net inflows of \u20ac 7 billion, the 16th consecutive quarter of net inflows, primarily reflecting successful deposit campaigns.\nAsset Management net revenues were \u20ac 2.4 billion in 2023, down 9% year on year. A 6% decline in management fees more than offset a slight rise in performance fees. Assets under Management grew by \u20ac 75 billion to \u20ac 896 billion during the year including net inflows of \u20ac 28 billion which were driven by Passive, Cash and Multi Asset products and including \u20ac 5 billion in ESG assets2. In the fourth quarter, Asset Management revenues were \u20ac 580 million, down 5% year on year. Management fees were down 3%, reflecting lower fees in Alternatives due to net outflows and lower real estate valuations, while Other revenues were negatively impacted by lower investment income and higher funding charges. These developments more than offset a 36% rise in performance fees. Assets under management grew \u20ac 37 billion in the quarter including net asset inflows of \u20ac 11 billion, driven by Passive and Cash.\nNoninterest expenses: continued discipline and investments in key areas\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 21.7 billion in 2023, up 6% year on year. This development largely reflected a rise in nonoperating costs to \u20ac 1.1 billion, up from \u20ac 474 million in 2022, largely related to the execution of the bank\u2019s Global Hausbank strategy. The year-on-year increase in 2023 nonoperating costs was driven primarily by restructuring and severance expenses of \u20ac 566 million, compared to a release of \u20ac 8 million in 2022, and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets of \u20ac 233 million, up from \u20ac 68 million in 2022, driven by the goodwill impairment charge related to Numis. Adjusted costs, which exclude nonoperating items, were \u20ac 20.6 billion, up 3%. Investments in business growth, controls and efficiency measures were partly offset by the aforementioned realised savings from the bank\u2019s operational efficiency programme.\nIn the fourth quarter, noninterest expenses were \u20ac 5.5 billion, up 5% year on year. This development reflected the aforementioned restructuring and severance costs and Numis-related goodwill impairment, partly offset by a release of litigation provisions in the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted costs were \u20ac 5.3 billion, up 9%, and included a number of exceptional items which are not expected to recur in future periods.\nThe workforce was 90,130 full-time equivalents (FTEs) at the end of 2023, an increase of 871 FTEs during the fourth quarter. This increase included 292 FTEs from Numis and 310 FTEs relating to the internalisation of external staff. These, together with other hires, more than offset leavers during the quarter.\nCredit provisions remain contained\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.5 billion in 2023, up from \u20ac 1.2 billion in 2022 and 31 bps of average loans, slightly above the bank\u2019s guidance, reflecting the continued challenging impact of macro-economic and interest rate conditions on parts of the credit portfolio during 2023.\nIn the fourth quarter, provision for credit losses was \u20ac 488 million, up from \u20ac 245 million in the third quarter. The quarter-on-quarter development partly reflects the non-recurrence of model-related adjustments in the previous quarter. Provision for performing (stage 1 and 2) loans was \u20ac 30 million, compared to largely model-driven releases of \u20ac 101 million in the third quarter, while provision for non-performing (stage 3) loans was \u20ac 457 million, compared to \u20ac 346 million in the third quarter, mainly driven by higher provisions in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank which were partly offset by lower provisions in the Investment Bank. Stage 2 provisions in the Private Bank Germany continued to be impacted by operational backlogs arising from the Postbank integration, representing \u20ac 28 million, which are expected partially to reverse in future quarters.\nStrong capital generation supports 50% growth in shareholder distributions\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.7% at the end of 2023, up from 13.4% at the end of 2022. Organic capital generation more than offset the combined impacts of dividends, share buybacks, regulatory RWA inflation and business growth during the year. Capital efficiency measures, which form part of Deutsche Bank\u2019s accelerated execution of its Global Hausbank strategy, delivered RWA reductions of \u20ac 13 billion during 2023.\nIn the fourth quarter, the CET1 ratio of 13.7% was slightly lower than 13.9% at the end of the third quarter, as organic capital generation in the quarter was more than offset by deductions for dividends and share buybacks and regulatory deductions for deferred tax assets. During the quarter, Deutsche Bank completed its \u20ac 450 million 2023 share repurchase programme as planned. Total distributions to shareholders from dividends and share repurchases amounted to over \u20ac 1 billion during 2023, up 50% over 2022, and bringing cumulative distributions to \u20ac 1.8 billion for 2022 and 2023.\nThe Leverage ratio was 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023, down from 4.7% in the previous quarter. The quarter-on-quarter development primarily reflected a slight rise in leverage exposure, partly driven by increased liquidity reserves due to higher deposits.\nLiquidity and funding strength\nLiquidity reserves were \u20ac 261 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, up from \u20ac 245 billion at the end of the third quarter, including High Quality Liquid Assets of \u20ac 219 billion, up from \u20ac 210 billion at the end of the third quarter. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 140%, above the regulatory requirement of 100%, representing a surplus of \u20ac 62 billion. The Net Stable Funding Ratio was 121%, slightly above the bank\u2019s target range of 115-120% and representing a surplus of \u20ac 109 billion above required levels.\nDeposits were \u20ac 622 billion at year-end 2023, up by \u20ac 11 billion during the fourth quarter, and by \u20ac 29 billion during the second half of 2023, slightly above the level of year-end 2022.    \nSustainable Finance: volumes\u00b2 reach \u20ac 279 billion in four years\nEnvironment, Social and Governance (ESG)-related financing and investment volumes\u00b2 were \u20ac 14 billion excluding DWS in the quarter, bringing the cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 279 billion, including \u20ac 64 billion in 2023. \nIn the fourth quarter, Deutsche Bank\u2019s businesses contributed as follows:\nCorporate Bank: \u20ac 3 billion in sustainable financing, raising the Corporate Bank\u2019s cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 53 billion.\nInvestment Bank: \u20ac 8 billion in sustainable financing and capital market issuance, for a cumulative total of \u20ac 167 billion since January 1, 2020.\nPrivate Bank: \u20ac 3 billion growth in ESG assets under management and new client lending, and a cumulative total of \u20ac 59 billion since January 1, 2020\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, Deutsche Bank published its Initial Transition Plan, outlining its future roadmap for achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Furthermore, the bank announced the formation of a new Nature Advisory Panel, which aims to help the bank assess nature-related risks and identify new financial product offerings tied to the challenge of reversing biodiversity loss. Deutsche Bank also became the first bank to join #BackBlue, a UN-backed finance commitment which aims to support ocean protection. The bank hosted multiple events at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, one in partnership with six German industrial companies. Deutsche Bank acted as Co-Lead of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) Real Estate Working Group which published its Emerging Practice Paper, Climate Target Setting for Real Estate Financing, during the quarter.\nMore details of Deutsche Bank\u2019s sustainability strategy, policies, commitments and activities can be found on http://www.db.com/sustainability\nGroup results at a glance\nAnnual Media Conference\nDeutsche Bank will host its Annual Media Conference at 09:00 CET today.

Products in scope include capital market issuance (bookrunner share only), sustainable financing and period-end assets under management. Cumulative volumes and targets do not include ESG assets under management within DWS, which are reported separately by DWS.\nESG Classification\nWe defined our sustainable financing and investment activities in the \u201cSustainable Financing Framework \u2013 Deutsche Bank Group\u201d which is available at investor-relations.db.com. Given the cumulative definition of our target, in cases where validation against the Framework cannot be completed before the end of the reporting quarter, volumes are reported upon completion of the validation in subsequent quarters. In Asset Management, DWS introduced its ESG Product Classification Framework (\u201cESG Framework\u201d) in 2021 taking into account relevant legislation (including Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 \u2013 SFDR), market standards and internal developments. The ESG Framework is further described in the Annual Report 2021 of DWS under the heading \u201dOur Product Suite \u2013 Key Highlights / ESG Product Classification Framework\u201d which is available at https://group.dws.com/ir/reports-and-events/annual-report/. There is no change in the ESG Framework in the fourth quarter of 2023. DWS will continue to develop and refine its ESG Framework in accordance with evolving regulation and market practice.\nRead the \nPDF\nfull media release as PDF document",
