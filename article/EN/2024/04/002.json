    "body": "Deutsche Bank is mourning the loss of its former Management Board member Frank Strauss, who died last week at the age of 54. Strauss was CEO of Postbank for six years and a member of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank for two years.\n\"It is with dismay and deep sadness that I and many Deutsche Bank colleagues learned of the premature death of Frank Strauss,\" said CEO Christian Sewing. \"Over a span of nearly 30 years at Deutsche Bank and Postbank, he served with great merit, especially in our retail banking business. He was a valued colleague to many of us and to me personally. We will honour Frank Strauss\u2019 memory. Our thoughts are with his wife, children and loved ones at this difficult time.\"\nStrauss spent a large part of his professional life at Deutsche Bank. After completing his training as a bank clerk in Iserlohn, he came to Frankfurt in 1995, where he worked in various management positions at Deutsche Bank and its former subsidiary Deutsche Bank 24. In 2006, he took over the management of the private and business customer division in the German home market. In 2011, he then moved to Postbank as its Management Board member responsible for sales and, a year later, he became CEO. From 2017 to 2019, he was a member of the Deutsche Bank Management Board and oversaw private and corporate banking, initially together with Sewing and, after the latter\u2019s appointment as CEO, from April 2018 alone.",
