Consequently, we see enormous potential for our deeply integrated, well diversified business in India.\nWe have boosted our capital allocation in India to enable our expansion and further deepen our presence in this critical growth market.  \nAlexander von zur Muehlen\n\u201cThis incremental capital into our India franchise is a strong validation of confidence in our business model and potential in this country.

Since then, it has grown to become one of the largest international banks in the country with a balance sheet size of INR 1,45, 235 crores as of 31 March 2024.\nFor further information, please contact:\nDeeptha Rajkumar\nPhone: +91 9819803395\nE-Mail: deeptha.rajkumar@db.com",
