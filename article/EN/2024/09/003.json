This reflects our strong franchise, positive momentum across our businesses, and sustained cost discipline. Our Global Hausbank is ideally positioned to help clients navigate the uncertainties in today\u2019s environment, and this reinforces our confidence that we will continue on our path of profitable growth and exceed our original goals for capital distributions to shareholders. We have now sought authorization for further share repurchases. \nChristian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer\nDeutsche Bank (XETRA: DBGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today announced profit before tax of \u20ac 2.3 billion for the third quarter of 2024, up 31% year on year. This included a partial release of approximately \u20ac 440 million in litigation provisions driven by progress on settlements relating to the bank\u2019s takeover of Postbank AG. Excluding the Postbank litigation release, profit before tax was \u20ac 1.8 billion, up 6%, compared to profit before tax of \u20ac 1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and a third-quarter record. Post-tax profit was \u20ac 1.7 billion, up 39% year on year, or \u20ac 1.3 billion excluding the Postbank litigation release, up 8%, compared to post-tax profit of \u20ac 1.2 billion in the prior year quarter.\nThird quarter post-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity (RoTE1) was 10.2%, or 7.6% if adjusted for the Postbank litigation release, up from RoTE1 of 7.3% in the prior year quarter. Post-tax return on average shareholders\u2019 equity (RoE)1 was 9.1%, compared to 6.5% in the prior year quarter. The cost/income ratio was 63%, or 69% if adjusted for the Postbank litigation release, down from a cost/income ratio of 72% in the prior year quarter.\nFor the first nine months of 2024, profit before tax was \u20ac 4.7 billion, down 5% year on year, or \u20ac 5.6 billion, up 13%, excluding the nine-month Postbank litigation impact of approximately \u20ac 900 million. Post-tax profit was \u20ac 3.2 billion, down 8%, or \u20ac 3.9 billion, up 14% excluding the Postbank litigation impact, compared to post-tax profit of \u20ac 3.5 billion in the prior year period. Post-tax RoTE1 was 6.0%, or 7.8% excluding the Postbank litigation impact, compared to RoTE1 of 7.0% in the prior year period. Post-tax RoE1 was 5.4%, compared to 6.3% in the prior year period. The cost/income ratio was 73%, or 69% excluding the Postbank litigation impact, compared to a cost/income ratio of 73% in the prior year period.\n\u201cOur nine-month 2024 results underline Deutsche Bank\u2019s operating strength,\u201d added James von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer. \u201dWe have consistently delivered on our guidance for both revenue growth and cost discipline; our capital and balance sheet are strong, and overall loan book quality remains solid. Looking ahead, this gives us confidence that we will meet our \u20ac 30 billion revenue guidance for the year 2024 and that our continued revenue momentum, cost efficiencies, capital strength and moderating credit provisions all put us on track to deliver on our 2025 goals.\u201d\nContinued delivery of the Global Hausbank strategy\nDeutsche Bank made progress on all dimensions of its accelerated Global Hausbank strategy in the third quarter:\nRevenue growth: Revenues grew 5% year on year to \u20ac 7.5 billion in the quarter, with 5% growth in commissions and fee income, as net interest income in the key segments of the banking book2 was broadly stable year on year. The bank\u2019s compound annual revenue growth rate over the last 12 months compared with the full year 2021 was 5.6% at the end of the quarter, within the bank\u2019s raised target range of between 5.5% and 6.5%.\nOperational efficiency: The bank made further progress on its \u20ac 2.5 billion Operational Efficiency program which includes optimization of the platform in Germany and workforce reductions, notably in non-client-facing roles. In the third quarter, total savings either realized or expected from measures completed reached \u20ac 1.7 billion, including \u20ac 1.5 billion in savings realized. Workforce reductions related to the program reached a cumulative total of approximately 3,300 full-time equivalents (FTEs), including approximately 600 during the third quarter, more than 90% of the planned total through year end 2024. In addition, contract external staff have been reduced by approximately 1,400, notably through internalisations, in the first nine months of 2024.\nCapital efficiency: Deutsche Bank delivered RWA equivalent benefits of a further \u20ac 3 billion during the third quarter through data and process improvements. As a result, cumulative RWA reductions from capital efficiency measures reached \u20ac 22 billion, marking further progress towards the bank\u2019s raised goal of \u20ac 25-30 billion by the end of 2025. Deutsche Bank continues to pursue additional opportunities to exceed this goal.\nRevenues: on track towards 2024 guidance\nNet revenues were \u20ac 7.5 billion in the third quarter, up 5% over the third quarter of 2023. Commissions and fee income grew 5% year on year to \u20ac 2.5 billion, reflecting strong performance of fee and commissions-based businesses, and net interest income in the key segments of the banking book2 was broadly stable in an environment of further normalisation of interest rates as anticipated. For the first nine months, revenues rose 3% to \u20ac 22.9 billion, driven by commissions and fee income which grew 9% to \u20ac 7.7 billion, in line with the expected glide path toward the bank\u2019s full-year 2024 guidance for revenues of around \u20ac 30 billion.\nRevenue development in the bank\u2019s operating businesses was as follows:\nCorporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 1.8 billion, down 3% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income was \u20ac 1.2 billion, down slightly year on year, reflecting normalizing deposit margins, mostly offset by growth in deposit volumes and higher loan net interest income. Commissions and fee income grew 4% to \u20ac 611 million, driven by growth in the Institutional Client Services business. Corporate Treasury Services revenues were \u20ac 1.0 billion, down 3% year on year, while Institutional Client Services revenues rose 3% to \u20ac 485 million. Business Banking revenues declined 9% year on year to \u20ac 328 million, reflecting lower net interest income compared to the strong levels of the prior year quarter. For the first nine months, net revenues declined 3% to \u20ac 5.6 billion. Corporate Treasury Services revenues were down 5% to \u20ac 3.2 billion, while Institutional Client Services revenues grew 5% to \u20ac 1.5 billion and Business Banking revenues declined 5% to \u20ac 1.0 billion.\nInvestment Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.5 billion, up 11% over the third quarter of 2023, with growth across both Fixed Income and Currencies (FIC) and Origination & Advisory. Revenues in FIC increased 11% to \u20ac 2.1 billion, with Credit Trading revenues significantly higher due to strength in Distressed and continued growth in the Flow business, reflecting investments in prior periods. Emerging Markets revenues were also significantly higher, reflecting growth across regions. Rates revenues were lower year on year in a market environment which remained uncertain, while Foreign Exchange revenues were higher, supported by continued strength in the Spot business. Financing revenues were essentially stable year on year. Origination & Advisory revenues were \u20ac 401 million, up 24% year on year with growth across business lines, as Deutsche Bank maintained its #1 ranking in Germany in the year to date. Debt Origination revenues were up 20%, reflecting a growing industry fee pool, and Advisory revenues were up 32% year on year, reflecting market share gains (source: Dealogic) as the business benefitted from prior investments. For the first nine months, Investment Bank revenues grew 12% to \u20ac 8.2 billion, driven primarily by growth of 58% in Origination & Advisory revenues to \u20ac 1.5 billion. Deutsche Bank\u2019s share of a growing global Origination & Advisory fee pool increased by around 50 basis points compared to the full year 2023 (source: Dealogic). FIC revenues rose 5% to \u20ac 6.7 billion, with growth in FIC ex. Financing led by strength in Credit Trading, while Financing revenues also grew 5% to \u20ac 2.4 billion. In the Euromoney FX Awards for 2024, Deutsche Bank was named Best FX Bank for both Western Europe and Asia Pacific.\nPrivate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.3 billion, essentially flat year on year. Net interest income declined by 6% in an environment of stabilizing interest rates; this was partly offset by growth in investment products, reflecting the Private Bank\u2019s strategy of growing noninterest income. Revenues in Personal Banking were down 5% year on year. This development reflected the impact of higher hedging and funding costs, partly driven by the discontinuation of remuneration for minimum reserves by the ECB, as well as lower lending revenues, partly reflecting a negative nonrecurring effect. These impacts were partly offset by growth in deposit revenues. Revenues in Wealth Management & Private Banking grew by 5% year on year, as double-digit growth in both lending and investment products more than offset a decline in deposit revenues. Assets under management grew by a further \u20ac 13 billion including net inflows of \u20ac 8 billion, consisting of \u20ac 5 billion in deposits and \u20ac 3 billion in investment products. For the first nine months, Private Bank net revenues were \u20ac 7.0 billion, down 2% year on year. A 6% year-on-year decline in Personal Banking revenues, to \u20ac 3.9 billion, was partly offset by 3% growth in Wealth Management & Private Banking revenues to \u20ac 3.1 billion. Assets under management rose to \u20ac 625 billion, their highest ever level and up by \u20ac 47 billion in the first nine months, driven partly by net inflows of \u20ac 27 billion, up from \u20ac 17 billion in the first nine months of 2023.\nAsset Management net revenues were \u20ac 660 million in the third quarter, up 11% over the third quarter of 2023. Management fees were \u20ac 626 million, up 6%, driven both by Active and Passive products and partly reflecting continued inflows into Passive products. Performance and transaction fees were \u20ac 12 million, down from \u20ac 19 million in the prior year quarter, driven by lower fees in Alternatives. Assets under management were a record \u20ac 963 billion at the end of the third quarter, compared to \u20ac 933 billion at the end of the previous quarter, driven by net inflows of \u20ac 18 billion, the second highest for any quarter, primarily in Passive and Fixed Income products, and the positive impact of rising market levels. For the first nine months, net revenues were \u20ac 1.9 billion, up 8% year on year, driven by 5% growth in management fees to \u20ac 1.8 billion, which more than offset a decline in performance and transaction fees to \u20ac 40 million, from \u20ac 87 million in the prior year period. Assets under management of \u20ac 963 billion were \u20ac 103 billion higher than at the end of third quarter of 2023.\nExpenses: adjusted costs remain in line with quarterly guidance for 2024\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 4.7 billion in the third quarter, down 8% from \u20ac 5.2 billion in the third quarter of 2023. This development primarily reflected the aforementioned Postbank litigation release of approximately \u20ac 440 million. Total nonoperating costs1 were \u20ac 302 million negative; the Postbank litigation release was partly offset by \u20ac 88 million in litigation provisions relating to other matters and \u20ac 42 million in restructuring and severance charges in the quarter. Excluding the Postbank litigation release, noninterest expenses were \u20ac 5.2 billion, essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted costs were \u20ac 5.0 billion in the third quarter, in line with the bank\u2019s 2024 quarterly adjusted cost guidance for the third consecutive quarter and up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. As anticipated, compensation and benefits expenses were higher due to wage growth, strategic growth initiatives including hiring, the acquisition of Numis and higher accruals for variable compensation; this was partly offset by lower technology costs, reflecting the bank\u2019s efforts to streamline its technology platform, and reductions in professional services fees.\nThe workforce was 90,236 internal full-time equivalents (FTEs) at the end of the third quarter, a rise of 766 during the quarter. This development reflected over 1,000 graduate hires who joined the bank during the quarter, other strategic hires, and the continued internalisation of external staff. These effects more than offset leavers, including through operational efficiency measures, in the quarter.\nFor the first nine months, noninterest expenses were \u20ac 16.8 billion, up 3% over the prior year period. Excluding the Postbank litigation impact, noninterest expenses were \u20ac 15.8 billion, 2% lower than noninterest expenses in the prior year period. Adjusted costs were down 1% to \u20ac 15.1 billion, in line with the bank\u2019s guidance for adjusted costs of \u20ac 5 billion per quarter during 2024.\nProvision for credit losses: solid underlying asset quality\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 494 million in the quarter, up from \u20ac 245 million in the prior year quarter and up slightly from \u20ac 476 million in the second quarter of 2024. Provisions for performing loans (Stage 1 and 2) were \u20ac 12 million, down from \u20ac 35 million in the previous quarter. This reflected softer macro-economic forecasts and the recalibration of overlays, partially offset by portfolio movements since the second quarter. Provision for non-performing loans (Stage 3) were \u20ac 482 million, up from \u20ac 441 million in the previous quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase was driven predominantly by the Private Bank and included residual effects from remaining impacts from Postbank integration which are expected to normalize in the coming quarters, while overall portfolio quality remained largely stable. Provisions relating to commercial real estate were down 34% compared to the previous quarter and included provisions relating to expected sales in the fourth quarter.\nFor the first nine months, provision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.4 billion, up from \u20ac 1.0 billion year on year. This development was substantially driven by certain larger corporate events, for which provisions are partly mitigated by offsetting hedges; residual impacts from the Postbank integration which are expected to decrease significantly going forward; and higher provisions in commercial real estate compared to the first nine months of 2023. The bank sees signs of stabilization in commercial real estate and expects this to support a further reduction in provisions in future quarters.\nSolid capital, liquidity and funding metrics\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.8% in the quarter, up from 13.5% in the previous quarter. This development reflected strong third-quarter earnings and the bank\u2019s adoption of transitional rules for unrealized gains and losses of certain debt instruments. These positive impacts more than offset higher risk weighted assets (RWA), predominantly higher market risk and credit risk RWA, net of reductions from the aforementioned capital efficiency measures as part of the accelerated execution of the Global Hausbank strategy. Deutsche Bank recently sought ECB authorization for further share repurchases.\nThe Leverage ratio was 4.6% in the quarter, stable compared to the previous quarter. The positive impact of the capital change in the quarter was offset by the impact of higher leverage exposures driven by trading assets during the quarter.\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 135% at the end of the quarter, stable compared to the end of the previous quarter, above the regulatory requirement of 100% and representing a surplus of \u20ac 60 billion. The Net Stable Funding Ratio was 122%, above the bank\u2019s guidance range of 115-120% and representing a surplus over requirements of \u20ac 112 billion. Deposits rose by \u20ac 9 billion to \u20ac 650 billion during the quarter.\nSustainable Finance: cumulative volumes since 2020 reach \u20ac 352 billion\nSustainable Financing and ESG investment volumes ex-DWS3 were \u20ac 30 billion in the quarter, bringing the cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 352 billion. Volumes in the third quarter included a \u20ac 10 billion one-time contribution following the integration of ESG criteria into Deutsche Bank\u2019s German pension plans which is recognized in Corporate & Other (C&O). Third-quarter volumes across the bank\u2019s businesses were as follows:\nCorporate Bank: \u20ac 2 billion in sustainable financing, raising the business\u2019s cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 65 billion\nInvestment Bank: \u20ac 15 billion, comprising \u20ac 4 billion in sustainable financing and \u20ac 11 billion in capital market issuance, raising the division\u2019s cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 211 billion\nPrivate Bank: \u20ac 3 billion growth in ESG assets under management and new client lending, raising the Private Bank\u2019s cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 66 billion\nIn the third quarter, notable transactions included:\nParticipation in a \u20ac 3.0 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility for Uniper SE, including CO2 reduction targets and expansion of renewable energies\nA \u20ac 227 million financing package, serving as lender, facility agent, and sole mandated lead arranger to the Republic of Senegal, represented by the Ministry of Economy, Planning & Cooperation.

Furthermore, in October, the bank improved its S&P Global Sustainable1 rating by 12 points from 54 points out of 100 to 66; this positions Deutsche Bank currently among the highest 10% of the category \u201cDiversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.\u201d In 2024 to date, Deutsche Bank\u2019s progress in its sustainability efforts has been recognized in five improvements from leading independent agencies, as follows:\nS&P Global Sustainable1: Deutsche Bank\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) score improved from 54 to 66 out of 100\nMSCI: In September, the bank\u2019s rating was upgraded from A (7.1) to AA (8.5), positioning Deutsche Bank within the top 20% of its subindustry category (Investment Banking & Brokerage)\nSustainalytics: in August, the bank improved its score 27.9 to 22.9, placing Deutsche Bank at the lower end of the \u2018Medium Risk\u2019 group\nCDP, formerly Carbon Disclosure Project: in February, Deutsche Bank maintained a stable B/Management rating with an increase in 7 of 12 sub-categories, scoring \u2018A\u2019 in 8\nISS ESG: in January, Deutsche Bank was upgraded from C/Prime to C+ /Prime\nGroup results at a glance\n\u00b9 For a description of this and other non-GAAP financial measures, see \u2018Use of non-GAAP financial measures\u2019 on pp 15-20 of the third quarter 2024 Financial Data Supplement and \u201cNon-GAAP financial measures\u201d on pp. 56 \u2013 62 of the Earnings Report of September 30, 2024, respectively\n\u00b2 Business segments for which net interest income from banking book activities represent a material part of the overall revenue\n\u00b3 Cumulative ESG volumes include sustainable financing (flow) and investments (stock) in the Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, Private Bank and Corporate & Other from January 1, 2020 to date.
