    "body": "First advert with the new logo from April 25, 1974\nFor the very first time on April 25, 1974, Deutsche Bank's new logo appeared in an advert in several major daily newspapers following its presentation to the public at the annual press conference.\n\nAnton Stankowski, the creator of the logo\n\u201cSlash in a square\u201d by Anton Stankowski (1906 \u2013 1998) was the winning design out of 140 other entries in a competition commissioned by Deutsche Bank to come up with a new logo for the company. Stankowski is considered a pioneer of graphic design and master of constructivism.\nWhen the bank was founded in 1870 it did not have a logo, using eagle symbols and later letter marks instead.\nDeutsche Bank used a stylized eagle and a letter mark in parallel for a long time.\nIn the 1970s, however, a pictorial symbolic language quickly gained popularity. Deutsche Bank realised that it had to evolve the way it presented itself to the public, especially as it was just starting to build an international presence. It sought out a logo that could be used globally, regardless of the type and language. This led to the competition and the slash in the square designed by Stankowski.\nWhen introducing the new logo, Deutsche Bank called on its employees to propose a name for it. \u201dWegweiser\u201d (signpost) was the most popular and was used in the first advert. Later, however, the slash in the square was mostly interpreted as a symbol of dynamic growth in a secure environment.\nUnchanged for half a century, this logo has long been a globally unmistakable trademark of Deutsche Bank.",
