Deutsche Bank will book an additional provision of approximately EUR 1.5 billion for IBOR and other matters in its first-quarter 2015 financial results.\nNo current or former member of the Management Board was found to have been involved in or aware of the trader misconduct.\nJ\u00fcrgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWe deeply regret this matter but are pleased to have resolved it. The Bank accepts the findings of the regulators.\n\u201cWe have disciplined or dismissed individuals involved in the trader misconduct; have substantially strengthened our control teams, procedures and record-keeping; and are conducting a thorough review of the Bank\u2019s actions in addressing this matter.\n\u201cThis agreement marks another step in addressing the past and ensuring that the Bank earns back the trust of its clients, shareholders and society at large.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank holds accountable those found to have acted inconsistently with its standards. It has worked intensively in investigating the matter. The Bank\u2019s internal investigation was the largest in its history, involving the collection of more than 150 million electronic documents and 850,000 audio files and the review of more than 21 million electronic documents and 320,000 audio files.\nThe Bank recognises that there were defects and delays in collecting and producing documents and audio. It has significantly increased the number of employees dedicated to electronic discovery to 200 and raised expenditure by 600% since 2012.\nSpecific changes to procedures and controls across Deutsche Bank include:\nCreating a Benchmark and Index Control Group, which now oversees the Bank\u2019s IBOR submissions and reports to Risk Management, an independent control function;\nCompletely segregating duties between LIBOR/EURIBOR submitters and traders, including physical separation. Submissions are now based on observable transactions, not estimates, to the greatest extent possible;\nUpgrading the Bank\u2019s systems and controls so that it can more quickly identify electronic and voice communications that are of interest to regulators and to the Bank. This is part of the previously announced EUR 1 billion programme to upgrade systems and controls.\n  For further information please contact:\nDeutsche Bank AG\nPress & Media Relations\nKathryn Hanes +44 (20) 754 56941\nMichele Allison +1 (212) 250 4735\ndb.presse@db.com\nInvestor Relations\n+49 69 910 35395 (Frankfurt)\n+1 212 250 1540 (New York)\ndb.ir@db.com\n   ",
