    "title": "Talking point: UN Climate Change Conference in Paris \u2013 between optimism and realism",
    "body": "Roughly 150 countries have submitted their national climate protection commitments in the run-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. While these commitments will probably not suffice to meet the 2\u00b0C target, related assessments are very favourable nonetheless.\nObviously, the bottom-up approach, that is to say the voluntary national climate protection commitments, promises greater progress than the globally coordinated negotiated solution targeted at past UN climate conferences. There is an awareness that the current proposals have shortcomings as regards the 2\u00b0C target, but there are hopes that the individual countries will aim for more ambitious targets over the next few years.\nSentiment is thus swinging between optimism and realism. Considering the growing demand for energy, the international community is clearly only just beginning to encounter the real challenges of climate protection.\nPDF\nResearch comment on UN Climate Change Conference in Paris",
