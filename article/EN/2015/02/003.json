    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) today published its 2014 Annual Report. This Report contains the Bank\u2019s audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2014 financial year and consists of two sections: the Annual Review and the Financial Report, which contains the 2014 Compensation Report. In addition, the Bank published its 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report and Human Resources Report.\nJ\u00fcrgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, Co-Chief Executive Officers, said: \u201cIn 2014, our profits improved despite challenging conditions. For the first time ever, all four of our core businesses delivered more than EUR 1 billion each in pre-tax profits. We further strengthened our capital base during the year. We have reduced total assets by nearly a quarter since June 2012, when the new management team took office, and continued to invest in systems, controls and governance. We reaffirmed our irreversible commitment to cultural change.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cDeutsche Bank today is a stronger, safer, better-balanced and more responsible institution than when we began this journey. We are aware the road ahead is challenging; we are now working diligently on the next phase of our strategy and look forward to sharing this with our stakeholders in the second quarter this year.\u201d\nFinancial Report\nIn 2014, income before income taxes increased from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 3.1 billion as did net income from EUR 0.7 billion to EUR 1.7 billon. The Bank\u2019s CRR/CRD 4 pro forma fully loaded Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at the end of 2014 was 11.7%, up from 9.7% at the end of 2013. The proposal for a cash dividend of EUR 0.75 per share remains unchanged from 2013.\nFinal and audited results at a glance:\n in EUR million  FY 2012  FY 2013  FY 2014  2014 vs. 2013 in %\n Net revenues  33,736  31,915  31,949  0%\n Total noninterest expenses  31,201  28,394  27,699  (2)%\n Income before income taxes  814  1,456  3,116  114%\n Income tax  498  775  1,425  84%\n Net income  316  681  1,691  148%\nThe Financial Report additionally presents an outlook for the global economy, the banking industry and Deutsche Bank. In 2015, Deutsche Bank anticipates further challenges in the macro-economic, market and regulatory environment. The Bank remains focused on responding to opportunities to strengthen client relationships through digital technology and innovation, while working more closely and intensively together to deliver \u201cone bank\u201d to clients.\nCompensation\nTotal compensation increased slightly to EUR 10.0 billion in 2014 (2013: EUR 9.9 billion). Variable compensation decreased to EUR 2.7 billion (2013: 3.2 billion), while fixed compensation rose to EUR 7.3 billion (2013: 6.7 billion). This development reflects adjustments in pay mix to comply with CRD 4 regulation, and the hiring of professionals to strengthen the Bank\u2019s control environment and ensure compliance with new regulation.\nManagement Board compensation was reduced by nearly 10% to EUR 35.3 million (2013: EUR 38.5 million).

During the year, 25% of all Senior Leadership Cadre appointments and two out of three Group Executive Committee appointments were women, reflecting the Bank\u2019s commitment to gender diversity. The Human Resources Report describes the Bank\u2019s investments in training and development during 2014. The Bank invested in young talent, hiring 832 new apprentices in Germany, an increase of 27%, year-on-year.

The Bank made substantial progress in implementing its \u2018Three Lines of Defence\u2019 program aimed at reinforcing the internal control environment and safeguarding against non-financial risk.\nThe Bank continued to expand its scrutiny of potential transactions for environmental and social risk; the number of transactions assessed rose to 1,250, up by more than 70% compared to 2013 and an 18-fold increase over 2011.
