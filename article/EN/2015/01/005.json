    "title": "Japan reduces CO2 emissions",
    "body": "While continued power efficiencies from equipment upgrades and usage contributed the largest absolute CO2 emission savings of 237,381 kg, a reduction of 1 million total kilometers in air travel during 2014 achieved the largest incremental savings with a 7.7% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Ongoing use of managed print services contributed a 4.3% saving as paper usage fell by 313,000 sheets to 6.96 million.\n\"Our disciplined use of electricity, air travel and paper usage has achieved 40% savings in CO2 emissions since we initiated the tracking of these resources in Japan in 2010. These substantive savings go beyond those required of us and demonstrate the commitment we have to ensuring we play a sustainable economic role.\" said Bret Dandoy, Chief Operating Officer for Japan\n\nAnnual electricity consumption has fallen from 10.7m kWh in 2010 to 7.44m kWh in 2014, largely through upgrades to environmental equipment and IT systems, as well as through conscientious power savings by staff who have also largely been behind other savings.\nStaff efforts have brought down annual consumption of paper by more than half from the 14.18m sheets used five years ago, while an ongoing 'Eco Cap' program initiated in 2009 has recycled 353,440 plastic bottle caps and contributed polio vaccinations for 473 children in developing countries, while also saving an estimated 2,755 kg of CO2 emissions.",
