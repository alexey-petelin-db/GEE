    "body": "The two power plants, both 10 megawatts (AC) each, have been awarded a 20-year power purchase contract by the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) under Ontario\u2019s Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) Program.\nThe loan, which has a one-year term after construction is complete, is expected to be repaid with the proceeds of the sales of the respective financed projects. In addition, the projects may be sold to Canadian Solar\u2019s upcoming YieldCo.\n\"This is the fourth construction loan package that Canadian Solar has signed with Deutsche Bank, and we value and respect our long-standing relationship with this reputable financial institution. The addition of these two projects underscores not only our successful collaboration with Deutsche Bank, but also our contribution to expanding the use of clean solar energy in Canada.\" commented Dr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Canadian Solar\nDeutsche Bank is one of the largest financiers of renewable energy worldwide. In 2014, the bank provided around EUR 1 billion in capital which helped finance projects of value more than EUR 4.3 billion and with a total capacity of approximately 1.8 gigawatt across Europe, North and South America and Asia.",
