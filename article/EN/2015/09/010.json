    "body": "Deutsche Bank today announced that it has been selected as a direct participating bank in China\u2019s newly launched Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (\u2018CIPS\u2019), as part of the first batch of approved participants.\n\nInitiated by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) and run by the CIPS Clearing Company, CIPS provides an independent cross-border payment and clearing system connecting both onshore and offshore clearing markets and participating banks. CIPS uses global payment standards and enables same day clearing across Asia, Oceania, Europe and other time zones through extended operating hours.\n\nCarl Wegner, Managing Director, Greater China Head of Global Transaction Banking at Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cBy integrating the existing Renminbi cross-border payment and settlement channels, CIPS will improve the efficiency of cross-border clearing to meet the increasing demand for Renminbi worldwide. CIPS will also enhance and facilitate the security of transactions, thereby benefitting the industry as well as our clients.\u201d\n\nFeng Gao, Managing Director, Chief Country Officer of Deutsche Bank China, added: \u201cWe are proud to be one of the few foreign banks chosen to participate in CIPS.
