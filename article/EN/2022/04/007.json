    "body": "For new contracts worth more than 500,000 euros a year, the bank will only work with vendors with an adequately high ESG rating \nCooperation with ESG rating agency EcoVadis  \nDeutsche Bank is taking a further step toward placing sustainability at the heart of all its business activities. Starting in July this year, every new or extended contract worth over 500,000 euros a year will require an external vendor sustainability rating from EcoVadis or another eligible rating agency. These are: MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics, ISS ESG, S&P Global und CDP.   \nDeutsche Bank spends more than 8 billion euros a year on products and services from third-party vendors and aims to use its significant purchasing power to drive greater ESG accountability and transparency across the supply chain and to ensure that all suppliers meet the highest environmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements.\nAs each supplier also has a network of interconnected suppliers, the policy should create a ripple effect, according to Alf Noto, Chief Procurement Officer at Deutsche Bank.\u202f \n\u201cSustainability is a collective responsibility,\u201d Noto says. \u201cWe want to collaborate with suppliers to help make a positive impact to extend the reach and impact of our ESG footprint.\u201d\nSuppliers will need to register with EcoVadis to undergo ESG assessment. The agency\u2019s comprehensive rating is based on a confidential sustainability questionnaire and evidence. The process gives companies a score out of 100. This will help suppliers identify improvement areas and allows them to use their ESG rating with other customers.\nFrom the beginning of 2023, it will no longer suffice for Deutsche Bank suppliers to have undergone ESG assessment. From this date onwards, the bank will only grant new contracts worth over 500,000 euros a year to vendors who have an adequately high sustainability rating \u2013 in the case of EcoVadis, this means achieving at least 25 of the 100 possible points.\nThe EcoVadis partnership follows the recent launch of the revised Supplier Code of Conduct which sets out the bank\u2019s expectations for suppliers and reflects its ESG principles. The bank said in May 2020 that it aims to facilitate over 200 billion euros in sustainable finance and investments and has since moved this target forward twice to end 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. \n\u201cGlobal Procurement is a great example of how we are moving from ambition to impact and partnering with our vendors to cover our whole value chain,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Eigendorf, Head of Sustainability at Deutsche Bank.\u202f\u202f\u201cThis is a big step to gradually improve the sustainability of our value chain.\u201d\nA number of ESG rating agencies have recently recognised the bank\u2019s progress. EcoVadis commended the bank for being \u201cproactive\u201d in sustainable procurement, while CDP raised the bank\u2019s climate change score from C to B. Credit ratings provider S&P Global scored Deutsche Bank 60 points, putting it back in the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index. Sustainalytics and WWF both upgraded their ratings.",
