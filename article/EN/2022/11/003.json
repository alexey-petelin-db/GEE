    "body": "We created ESG Quarterly as a way to regularly inform our stakeholders about our bank\u2019s sustainability efforts. The newsletter will provide concise information on what we have achieved and which topics our focus is on \u2013 now and in the near future. That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling the main feature \u201cWhat\u2019s on our mind\u201d. The \u201cMeet our experts\u201d section is where we introduce our sustainability ambassadors \u2013 the people in our bank who play a key role in driving our sustainability agenda forward. For the current issue we spoke to Chris Jaques, our Head of Group Enterprise Risk Management. He explains how the importance of climate risk has changed in the past ten years and what major challenges for everyone dealing with climate risk are.   ",
