    "title": "Deutsche Bank helps Continuum Green Energy expand renewable energy capacity",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank acted as Sole Private Placement Agent, helping Continuum Green Energy Ltd, Singapore raise USD 350 million from international investors. The funds raised will be utilised for refinancing existing debt and to support the company\u2019s expansion plans for renewable energy production through its wind and solar hybrid projects. The company expects to almost double the size of their portfolio to 2.5 gigawatts, from the current 1.3 gigawatts. They have the option of raising an additional USD 50mn on fulfilling certain conditions. \nEngaging with marquee institutional investors, the bankers priced the issuance despite unprecedented market volatility during the last few months. \u201cThe international debt capital markets continue to remain volatile on account of rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions,\u201d said Sameer Gupta, Head India Debt Capital Markets. \u201cAdverse market conditions notwithstanding, capital remains available for strong credit and the right structures.\u201d \nIn 2021, Deutsche Bank acted as Sole Left Lead on Continuum Green Energy\u2019s debut bond and also executed the world\u2019s first green hedge for them. The proceeds of the green bond were used for renewable energy projects in India.\nContinuum Energy is a leading renewable energy company in India, with majority of its assets focused on commercial and industrial consumers.",
