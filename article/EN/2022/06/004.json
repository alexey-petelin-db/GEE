We are particularly pleased with the progress of our Corporate Bank and Private Bank. Thanks to our successful transformation, we\u2019re well on track to deliver sustainable and well-balanced returns through our four strong core businesses.\nChristian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer\nDeutsche Bank (XETRA: DBGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today announced its highest second-quarter and half-year post-tax profits since 2011. Profit before tax was \u20ac 1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2022, up 33% year on year, while post-tax profit was up 46% to \u20ac 1.2 billion.\nPost-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity (RoTE)1 was 7.9%, up from 5.5% in the prior year quarter. Post-tax return on average shareholders\u2019 equity (RoE) was 7.1% in the quarter, up from 4.9% in the prior year quarter. The cost/income ratio improved to 73%, from 80% in the second quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate of 22% for the quarter benefited from a change in the geographical mix of income.\nFor the first six months, profit before tax was \u20ac 3.2 billion, up 16%, and post-tax profit was up 31% to \u20ac 2.4 billion. Profit attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders was up 32% to \u20ac 2.1 billion. Post-tax RoTE1 was 8.0%, up from 6.5% in the first six months of 2021, and post-tax RoE was 7.2%, up from 5.8%. The cost/income ratio improved to 73%, from 78% in the prior year period. Results for the first six months of 2022 included bank levies of \u20ac 736 million, up \u20ac 189 million, or 34%, over the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the first six months was 24%.\n2022 targets updated, 2025 targets reaffirmed\nDeutsche Bank reaffirms 2022 revenue guidance of \u20ac 26-27 billion despite the deterioration in the macro-economic environment seen in the second quarter and expectations for a more challenging second half of the year.\nThe bank remains committed to continuing its cost reduction efforts and will continue to execute on its 2022 plan. However, the bank also recognises increasing cost pressures from factors outside its control including higher-than-expected bank levies, inflation, unforeseen costs related to the war in Ukraine, and litigation matters. The bank also made the decision not to cap strategic investments in its control environment, staff, and technology to drive growth and efficiency, which are important for its long-term strategic direction as outlined in the Investor Deep Dive of March 10, 2022.\nIn the light of both revenue and cost developments, Deutsche Bank has updated its 2022 targets as follows:\nThe bank continues to target a post-tax RoTE1 of 8% (Group) and above 9% (Core Bank) for the year 2022, while recognising that the current operating environment makes delivery on these targets more challenging\nThe bank\u2019s guidance is now for a cost/income ratio in the mid- to low-70s percent for 2022\nDeutsche Bank confirms all other 2022 financial targets including a CET1 capital ratio of above 12.5% and a leverage ratio of around 4.5%.\nThe bank reaffirms the goals of its strategy of sustainable growth through 2025. For 2025, the bank targets compound annual revenue growth of 3.5-4.5%; post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of greater than 10%, and a cost/income ratio of below 62.5%. The bank also reaffirms its aim for cumulative capital distributions of around \u20ac 8 billion in respect of the years 2021-2025.\nBased on the resilience we have demonstrated in the first half, we reaffirm our 2022 revenue guidance, which we raised earlier this year. We continue to work towards our eight percent return on tangible equity target. At the same time, we face cost pressures in a more difficult environment than expected and continue to invest in the long-term strength of our platform. We remain fully committed to our sustainable growth strategy and to all our financial targets for 2025.\nJames von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer\nCore Bank: broad-based profit growth\nThe Core Bank, which excludes the Capital Release Unit, produced profit before tax of \u20ac 1.7 billion, up 21% year on year. Profit growth reflected 6% revenue growth to \u20ac 6.6 billion, combined with a 1% reduction in noninterest expenses to \u20ac 4.7 billion. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies were up 4% to \u20ac 4.6 billion and up 1% if adjusted for FX movements. Post-tax RoTE1 was 9.5%, consistent with the Core Bank\u2019s full year 2022 target of above 9% and up from 7.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Post-tax RoE was 8.4%, up from 6.9%. The Core Bank\u2019s cost/income ratio was 70%, down from 76% in the prior year quarter.\nThe core businesses contributed as follows to the Core Bank\u2019s profit growth:\nCorporate Bank: profit before tax of \u20ac 534 million, more than double year on year, with post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of 13.4% and cost/income ratio of 62%\nInvestment Bank: profit before tax of \u20ac 1.1 billion, up 1%, with post-tax RoTE1 of 11.4% and a cost/income ratio of 57%\nPrivate Bank: profit before tax of \u20ac 463 million, versus a \u20ac 15 million loss before tax in the prior year quarter, post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of 9.9% and a cost/income ratio of 74%\nAsset Management: profit before tax of \u20ac 170 million, down 6% year on year, post-tax RoTE1 of 18.6% and cost/income ratio of 67%\nFor the first six months, Core Bank pre-tax profit was up 9% to \u20ac 3.7 billion and post-tax RoTE1 was 10.1%, up from 9.3% in the first half of 2021. The cost/income ratio was 70%, down from 73% in the prior year period. The combined profit before tax of the Corporate Bank, Private Bank and Asset Management was \u20ac 2.1 billion, or 56% of the Core Bank\u2019s profit before tax in the first six months, compared to 32% for the first six months of 2021.\nCapital Release Unit: further portfolio reduction and P&L improvement\nThe Capital Release Unit maintained its progress on portfolio reduction. Leverage exposure was reduced by a further \u20ac 6 billion to \u20ac 29 billion during the second quarter and risk weighted assets (RWAs) were stable at \u20ac 25 billion, including operational risk RWAs of \u20ac 19 billion. The Capital Release Unit remains ahead of its year-end 2022 targets for both leverage exposure and RWA reduction and has cut leverage exposure by \u20ac 220 billion, or 89%, and RWAs by \u20ac 40 billion, or 61%, since its creation in mid-2019.\nThe Capital Release Unit further reduced its loss before tax to \u20ac 181 million, down 30% year on year and the lowest quarterly loss since its creation in 2019. The improvement was driven primarily by a 26% year-on-year reduction in noninterest expenses, while net revenues were \u20ac 7 million positive, versus \u20ac 24 million negative in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower impacts from de-risking, risk management and funding.\nRevenue growth across all core businesses in second quarter and first half year\nNet revenues were \u20ac 6.6 billion, up 7% year on year and the highest second-quarter revenues since 2016, despite business exits related to transformation since 2019. In the core businesses, net revenues were as follows:\nCorporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 1.6 billion, up 26% year on year, the highest since the formation of the Corporate Bank in 2019 and the third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Growth was driven by a normalising interest rate environment, growth in business volumes and higher fee income. Revenues in Corporate Treasury Services were up 30%, Institutional Client Services revenues rose 26% and Business Banking revenues were up 9%. Gross loans were up \u20ac 12 billion, or 11%, and deposits rose by \u20ac 19 billion, or 7%, over the prior year quarter. For the first six months, net revenues were up 18% to \u20ac 3.0 billion.\nInvestment Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.6 billion, up 11% year on year. Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) revenues grew 32% to \u20ac 2.4 billion, the highest second-quarter FIC revenues for ten years. Net revenues in Rates, Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets all more than doubled year on year, which more than offset a decline in Credit Trading compared with a strong prior year quarter. Origination & Advisory revenues declined by 63% year on year, reflecting markdowns on Leveraged Finance commitments which impacted debt origination revenues. Adjusted for these, Origination & Advisory revenues were down 38% year on year, against the backdrop of a 45% year-on-year decline in the industry fee pool (source: Dealogic). Advisory revenues were up 50%, reflecting market share gains. For the first six months, net revenues were up 9% to \u20ac 6.0 billion.\nPrivate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.2 billion, up 7% year on year, or 4% if adjusted for two effects: a significant reduction in forgone revenues from the ruling by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) in April 2021 regarding pricing changes on current accounts, partly offset by lower revenues from Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany were up 11%, or 3% if adjusted for the reduced impact of the BGH ruling, while the International Private Bank grew revenues by 2%, or 6% if adjusted for the effect on revenues of Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Net new business volumes were \u20ac 11 billion in the quarter. This included net inflows of \u20ac 7 billion, including inflows into investment products of \u20ac 5 billion and new deposits of \u20ac 2 billion, and net new client loans of \u20ac 4 billion. For the first six months, net revenues were up 4% to \u20ac 4.4 billion and net new business volumes were \u20ac 24 billion.\nAsset Management net revenues rose 5% year on year to \u20ac 656 million. This development was predominantly driven by a 6% rise in management fees to \u20ac 619 million, partly reflecting inflows in previous quarters, while performance and transaction fees were up 69% to \u20ac 31 million. Net outflows were \u20ac 25 billion, driven almost entirely by outflows of low-margin cash products in a challenging macro-economic environment, of which the majority returned during July. Net outflows excluding cash products were essentially zero, as net inflows from active Equity, Multi-Asset and Alternatives offset outflows in Passive products. Assets under management were \u20ac 833 billion at quarter-end, down 3% versus the prior year quarter, reflecting the aforementioned net outflows together with market conditions, partly offset by FX movements. For the first six months, net revenues were up 6% to \u20ac 1.3 billion.\nRevenue growth in Deutsche Bank\u2019s core businesses more than offset negative revenues in Corporate & Other which were negative \u20ac 370 million in the quarter, compared to negative \u20ac 6 million in the prior year quarter. This development primarily reflected valuation and timing differences on derivatives used to hedge the economic risk of the bank\u2019s balance sheet. These accounting impacts were driven by market volatility which persisted during the quarter and rising interest rates, partly offset by cross-currency basis effects. On aggregate, negative valuation effects are expected to reverse over time as the underlying instruments approach maturity.\nFor the first six months, net revenues were \u20ac 14.0 billion, up 4%, for both the Group and the Core Bank, and the highest half-year net revenues since 2016.\nExpenses: reductions in the quarter and year to date, despite higher bank levies\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 4.9 billion in the quarter, down 3% year on year. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies\u00b9 were up 2% to \u20ac 4.7 billion. This development primarily reflected FX movements which were a significant driver of higher compensation & benefits and information technology expenses. Excluding the impact of FX movements, adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies declined 2%.\nFor the first six months, noninterest expenses were down 3% to \u20ac 10.2 billion, despite several factors. These included higher bank levies; additional litigation provisions relating to, among other matters, regulatory investigations into employees\u2019 use of unapproved personal devices and the bank\u2019s record-keeping requirements, and costs arising from the war in Ukraine which included the relocation of technology personnel. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies were down 1% to \u20ac 9.3 billion, and down 3% if adjusted for FX movements.\nThe workforce was reduced by a further 85 full time equivalents (FTEs) to 82,915 internal FTEs during the quarter, a reduction of 882 FTEs since the end of the second quarter of 2021, despite strategic hiring and continued internalisation of external staff.\nCredit provisions: growth reflects a challenging environment\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 233 million in the quarter, up from \u20ac 75 million in the second quarter of 2021. Stage 1 and 2 provisions were \u20ac 52 million, compared to net releases of \u20ac 36 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting less favourable macroeconomic variables which were partly offset by otherwise improved portfolio parameters. Provision for non-performing (stage 3) loans rose to \u20ac 181 million, up from \u20ac 111 million in the prior year quarter, mainly driven by the non-recurrence of larger stage 3 releases which favorably impacted the prior year quarter.\nConsistent with earlier guidance, Deutsche Bank expects provision for credit losses to be in a range of approximately 25 basis points of average loans. This reflects the current operating environment, including management expectations for a further gradual deterioration of economic conditions.\nRussia exposure further reduced\nDeutsche Bank further reduced its Russian credit exposures during the second quarter. Additional contingent risk was reduced by 42% during the quarter to \u20ac 0.6 billion. This comprised undrawn commitments of \u20ac 0.4 billion, down 44% during the quarter, which are largely mitigated by Export Credit Agency coverage and contractual drawdown protection, while guarantees were reduced by 35% to \u20ac 0.1 billion. Gross loan exposure was largely unchanged at \u20ac 1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, while net loan exposure was \u20ac 0.5 billion. In 2022 to date, additional contingent risk is down 63% and net loan exposure down 19%.\nCapital and liquidity in line with goals\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.0% at the end of the second quarter, up from 12.8% at the end of the first quarter, above the bank\u2019s target minimum of 12.5%. The quarter-on-quarter development largely reflected the positive impact on capital from strong second-quarter earnings, partly offset by accruals for dividends and Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1) coupons, together with negative other comprehensive income (OCI).\nThe Leverage ratio was 4.3% in the quarter, down from 4.6% in the first quarter, reflecting the discontinuation, from April 1, 2022, of the exclusion of certain central bank cash balances from the Leverage ratio. Including central bank cash balances in both periods, the Leverage ratio was essentially unchanged from the first quarter. The negative impact of higher leverage exposures, due to business activity and FX movements, was offset by the positive impact of strong earnings and the bank\u2019s AT1 issuance in March 2022 which was settled in early April.\nLiquidity reserves were \u20ac 244 billion at the end of the second quarter, essentially unchanged from \u20ac 246 billion at the end of the first quarter, including High Quality Liquid Assets of \u20ac 207 billion. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 133%, above the regulatory requirement of 100% and a surplus of \u20ac 51 billion. The Net Stable Funding Ratio was 116%, within the bank\u2019s target range of 115-120%, with a surplus of \u20ac 83 billion above required levels.\nSustainable Finance: further progress toward accelerated targets\nEnvironment, Social and Governance (ESG)-related financing and investment volumes2 were \u20ac 14 billion ex-DWS in the quarter, bringing the cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 191 billion. ESG financial and investment volumes were below recent quarters, reflecting several factors. These included lower overall capital market issuance activity, which also impacted sustainable financing volumes; more muted investment activity against a backdrop of lower asset valuations; and lower levels of sustainability activities as companies prioritised their responses to the war in Ukraine. However, Deutsche Bank remains well on track to reach its ESG cumulative volume target of at least \u20ac 200 billion by the end of 2022.\nIn the second quarter, Deutsche Bank\u2019s businesses contributed as follows:\nCorporate Bank: \u20ac 2 billion in sustainable financing, raising the Corporate Bank\u2019s cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 32 billion. Notable transactions during the quarter included the signing of a \u20ac 400 million supply chain financing linked to ESG ratings for Henkel AG & Co. KGaA\nInvestment Bank: \u20ac 9 billion in sustainable financing and capital market issuance, for a cumulative total of \u20ac 106 billion. This included the Austrian government\u2019s first green bond, a \u20ac 4 billion issuance due in 2049\nPrivate Bank: \u20ac 1 billion growth in ESG assets under management and a further \u20ac 1 billion in ESG new client lending, raising the Private Bank\u2019s cumulative total to \u20ac 52 billion\nIn addition to cumulative volumes since January 2020 of over \u20ac 200 billion by the end of 2022, Deutsche aims to achieve a further \u20ac 100 billion per year from 2023 to 2025, reaching a cumulative total of over \u20ac 500 billion by the end of 2025.\nThe bank reaffirmed its aim to publish 2050 net zero targets for its key carbon intensive portfolios, together with intermediate targets for 2030 at its second Sustainability Deep Dive later in 2022.\nDeutsche Bank will strengthen its sustainability governance by creating the position of Chief Sustainability Officer with effect from September 1, 2022.\nGroup results at a glance\nPrior year segmental information presented in the current structure\nStarting with Q1 2022, leverage ratio is presented as reported, as the fully loaded definition has been discontinued due to immaterial differences; comparative information for earlier periods is unchanged and based on DB\u2019s earlier fully loaded definition\n1For a description of this and other non-GAAP financial measures, see \u2018Use of non-GAAP financial measures\u2019 on pp 17-25 of the second quarter 2022 Financial Data Supplement and \u201cNon-GAAP financial measures\u201d on pp. 102-109 of the second quarter 2022 Interim Report, respectively\n2Cumulative ESG volumes include sustainable financing (flow) and investments (stock) in the Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Private Bank from January 1 2020 to date, as set forth in Deutsche Bank\u2019s Sustainability Deep Dive of May 20, 2021.
