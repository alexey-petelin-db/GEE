    "body": "Kimberly Hammonds' untimely passing fills us with deep sadness. In her five years at Deutsche Bank from 2013 to 2018, two of which were spent on our Management Board, she made a lasting contribution - with her fresh perspective and courage to make profound changes. She laid the foundations upon which we further modernised our technology and digitalised our business.\nWe honour Kim Hammonds' memory. Our thoughts and deep condolences are with her family.\nDeutsche Bank will be making a donation in Kim\u2019s honor to The Zoe Foundation, an organization she founded to fund art programs for cancer patients being treated throughout the United States. Information and a link to make further donations can be found here: https://www.thezoefoundation.org/ ",
