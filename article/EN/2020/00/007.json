    "title": "Christian Sewing in Davos: Europe needs a new narrative to drive growth",
    "body": "Europe\u2019s strategy for returning to economic growth must include a \u201cnew narrative\u201d explaining its broader purpose, Christian Sewing said at the World Economic Forum in Davos this morning. Speaking on a panel titled \"After Brexit: Renewing Europe's Growth\", the CEO said measures such as supportive monetary and fiscal policies, deregulation and promoting innovation remain essential.\nBut to catch up with the US and Asia, they must be accompanied by \u201ca new narrative for Europe\u201d. \u201cPeople still see Europe as the project which brought peace. That was a fantastic achievement. But we need to explain to our people what Europe stands for now,\u201d Sewing said.\nThis means framing initiatives such as deregulation and the European Green Deal around this wider narrative, to explain what it means for Europeans and the bloc\u2019s potential. \u201cIf we do this, then I think there are great chances for this region.\u201d\nThe importance of the European Union\u2019s updated social mission also influences Sewing\u2019s views on monetary policy.\nWhile banks can to some extent restructure to offset negative rates, he explained, the vast majority of EU citizens are losing out, creating a political issue.\nTurning to Brexit, Frank Appel, CEO of Deutsche Post DHL Group, summed up the panellists\u2019 views that it remains \u201ca bad idea that will hurt the UK and Europe.\u201d However, it was also highlighted that the certainty which has emerged following December\u2019s UK General Election was good for all sides.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the result but it is certain,\u201d said Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, European Commission, adding that: \u201c11 months is a very short time to negotiate a trade deal but we will do everything in our power to create the best possible relationship with the UK.\u201d\nThis point was echoed by Sewing who said the EU must do everything it can to minimise uncertainty and focus on creating \u201ca platform for growth\u201d.\nThe discussion also included Roberto Gualtieri, Minister of Economy and Finance of Italy; and was moderated by CNBC anchor Sara Eisen.",
