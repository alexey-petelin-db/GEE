    "title": "2020 DFAST/CCAR results: A message from Christiana Riley and Christian Sewing to staff",
    "body": "Dear Colleagues,\nToday, the Federal Reserve published results of its 2020 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST) and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).\nFor the second year in a row, our primary U.S. regulator did not object to the DBUSA capital plan on a quantitative or qualitative basis. This is good news and an important step forward, demonstrating that our bank\u2019s transformation is squarely on track.\nChange takes time, and through focus, discipline and investment, we are making tangible progress. This progress is well recognized by our shareholders, our clients and our regulators. It is our firm commitment that we will not let up in our effort to further improve our processes and controls, and our focus will be at least as rigorous here as in implementing the rest of our strategy.\nThank you to all of colleagues in America, the UK and Germany for their dedication and hard work to ensure we improve further.\nChristiana Riley & Christian Sewing",
