    "body": "Deutsche Bank joins in celebrating the landmark victory for LGBTQI rights following the United States Supreme Court ruling which protects gay and transgender workers from discrimination in the workplace. In a 6-3 decision, the court decided that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBTQI employees from being discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In the majority ruling, Justice Gorsuch said, \u201cAn employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.\"\nDeutsche Bank, along with many other major corporates previously joined the friend of the court amicus brief organized by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) in support of this decision. \u201cWe welcome this important ruling and I am proud that Deutsche Bank has been a long-time campaigner for LGBTQI rights worldwide,\u201d said Chief Risk Officer and Management Board member Stuart Lewis, who is also the global sponsor of dbPride. President of the bank and Management Board member, Karl von Rohr added, \u201cDiscrimination of any sort has no place in our bank and we welcome this long-awaited reform of workers\u2019 rights in the US.\u201d\nThe bank\u2019s existing global code of conduct has long prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation and has even achieved a top score of 100% on the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equity Index annually since 2002. The Corporate Equity Index is a national benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices pertinent to LGBTQI employees.",
