    "title": "The Age of Disorder",
    "body": "The world is on the cusp of a new era that will be characterised initially by disorder with a likely loosening of the globalisation that created the rapid economic and asset price growth of the last 40 years, according to Deutsche Bank\u2019s Long-Term Asset Return Study 2020.\nThe flagship annual publication argues that 2020 marks the beginning of a new \u201cstructural super-cycle\u201d of the kind that \u201cshapes everything from economies to asset prices, politics, and our general way of life.\u201d\nThe team, led by Strategist Jim Reid, predict an \u201cAge of Disorder\u201d \u2013 which is hastened, but not caused by, the corona virus \u2013 threatens the current high global asset valuations and will see governments and corporates take on even more debt.\nIn terms of geopolitics, tension between the US and China should \u201ccharacterise the era of disorder\u201d as China continues its path to restoring its historic role as a global economic powerhouse while preferring its own values to Western liberalism.\n\u201cA clash of cultures and interests therefore beckons, especially as China grows closer to being the largest economy in the world,\u201d the report says.\nThe Age of Disorder \u2013 specifically the next 10 years - could also be \u201ca make-or-break decade for Europe\u201d, the report says, arguing that the chances of muddling through for Europe have decreased and while the potential for further integration has increased with the recent Recovery Fund, the economic divergences will likely increase further and cause more stress points post-Covid.\nThe eight themes that will define the Age of Disorder are:\n1. Deteriorating US/China relations and the reversal of unfettered globalisation.\n2. A make-or-break decade for Europe.\n3. Even higher debt and MMT/helicopter money becoming mainstream.\n4. Inflation or deflation?\n5. Inequality worsening before a backlash and reversal takes place.\n6. The intergenerational divide widening.\n7. The climate debate will build.\n8. Technology revolution or bubble?\nThe report examines the current situation - The second era of globalisation (1980-2020?) \u2013 describing it as \u201cthe best combined asset price growth of any era in history, with equity and bond returns very strong across the board. It\u2019s unlikely that the Age of Disorder can see such performance maintained, especially in real terms.\u201d\nBut the report concludes: \u201cIn the years ahead, simply extrapolating past trends could be the biggest mistake you make\u201d.\nTo read the full report click here.
