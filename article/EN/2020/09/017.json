    "body": "When Rose Zhu joined Deutsche Bank in 2003 as the SARS outbreak was disrupting lives and businesses across Asia, she did not foresee that one day she would be in the driver\u2019s seat, leading Deutsche Bank\u2019s overall business offerings in China, including helping clients and staff manage the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, and helping them recover from it.\nSpeaking about her career at the bank to Asiamoney, she said. \u201cI certainly never set out to be the China chief country officer. I just exerted my utmost every day, focused on what I do, and tried to do it to the best of my ability.\u201d\nAfter a promotion to China chief operating officer, Zhu set out to build Deutsche Bank\u2019s footprint in China. \u201cI upgraded the representative office in Beijing to a full branch, set up two securities representative offices in Beijing and Shanghai, and oversaw our investments in Harvest Fund Management and Huaxia Bank,\u201d she said.\nDiscussing gender inclusion in China\u2019s financial services industry, Zhu said that she sees an increase in female talent entering the board level at the state-owned banks and at the main Chinese policy banks over the coming years. \u201cThe talent is there, it\u2019s rising \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of time before it reaches the top,\u201d she said. More than 70% of Deutsche Bank China\u2019s employees and half of the local management team are women.\nRead the full article\nTop ten ranking for supporting women in Asia\u2019s financial markets\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s commitment to build a more inclusive workplace in Asia was recognised in Asiamoney\u2019s 2020 Leaders for Women Survey. The bank was ranked among the top ten international banks for encouraging women in the workplace in Asia\u2019s financial markets, in three out of the four categories.\nDeutsche Bank scored best in the category that focused on the percentage of women in senior management in the region, with women making up 28% of these roles. The bank also placed in the top ten for the overall \u2018Women in the workplace\u2019 ranking and for gender diversity at the graduate ranking.\nKate Grant, Head of Human Resources for Asia Pacific said: \u201cThis recognition underscores our commitment to improve gender inclusion in the bank at all levels. We have some way to go to increase the representation of women in our workplace, but this survey and the encouraging results show that we are making positive progress.\u201d",
