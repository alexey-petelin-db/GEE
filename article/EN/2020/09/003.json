    "body": "A new Deutsche Bank Research report, America\u2019s Racial Gap & Big Tech\u2019s Closing Window, uncovers a host of stark statistics on the digital racial gap and possible long-term employment implications for minorities.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Global Head of Technology Investment Strategy Apjit Walia conducted the bottom-up societal study and concluded that if this \u201cdigital racial gap is not addressed, in one generation alone, digitisation could render the country\u2019s minorities into an unemployment abyss.\u201d\nWalia found the data to be more glaring than expected, as indicated in some of the key findings:\nGiven the exponential growth of the digital economy, 76 percent of Blacks and 62 percent of Hispanics could get shut out from or be under-prepared for 86 percent of jobs in the US by 2045\nBlacks and Hispanics are 10 years behind Whites in levels of broadband access and almost 4 times more Blacks have poorer tech connectivity than Whites\nWhile 83 percent of Whites own a personal computer, that rate drops to 60 percent for Blacks and 51 percent for Hispanics\nJust over 1 out of 20 Blacks feel privacy is a primary concern as it relates to tech\nOnly 1 in 3 Americans now hold a positive view of Big Tech\nCan Big Tech close the gap?\nBig Tech can play a critical role in finding a solution. Walia argues that if large companies commit USD 15 billion dollars over the next five years\u2013 which equates to less than 1 percent of the USD 2 trillion dollar increase in Big Tech 5\u2019s market cap during Covid \u2013 there would be a meaningful shift in the racial digital divide.\n\u201cThere are no guarantees in life or investing, but for Big Tech to come together and find a solution or a small step in the direction of the solution to one of the most egregious divides in our society could change the national discourse on these companies,\u201d Walia said in the note. \u201cAnd that would only boost their long term prospects and returns.\u201d\nAmerica\u2019s Racial Gap & Big Tech\u2019s Closing Window can be downloaded from the\nPDF\npublic Research site.\n ",
