    "title": "Berliner Philharmoniker: Digital Concert Hall free of charge for everyone",
    "body": "Due to the Corona crisis, the Philharmonie will probably close until April 19, but no one will have to miss the concerts of the Berliner Philharmoniker. Under the motto \u201eThe Philharmonie is closed \u2013 so we will come to you!\", the Berliner Philharmoniker have opened their virtual concert hall, the \"Digital Concert Hall\", to everyone free of charge.\nTo do so, register with the code BERLINPHIL and then use the entire Digital Concert Hall free of charge for 30 days. Originally you should have redeemed the voucher by March 31, 2020 \u2013 this restriction has been lifted until further notice.\nDeutsche Bank has been the exclusive partner of the Berliner Philharmoniker for over 30 years. Together with the orchestra, the bank has also made the Digital Concert Hall possible. This allows classical music fans to experience the concerts of the Berliner Philharmoniker anytime, anywhere on the Internet \u2013 in brilliant picture and sound quality.\nIn the virtual hall, there are over 600 orchestral concerts from the Berliner Philharmoniker from more than ten years, including 15 concerts with the new chief conductor Kirill Petrenko. In addition, there are bonus videos from behind the scenes: documentaries on the history of the orchestra, portraits of conductors and orchestra members, and projects from the education programme that Deutsche Bank particularly supports.",
