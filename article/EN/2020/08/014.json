    "body": "Deutsche Bank has won a prestigious Euromoney award for \u201cWorld's Best Bank Transformation\u201d for the progress it has made in the strategic transformation it launched last year to become stronger, more efficient and better positioned for the future.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Deutsche Bank has resisted the distractions in market conditions that might have grabbed all its attention in the past,\u201d the editorial team of the leading industry publication wrote in announcing the award today. \u201cIts transformation is still a work in progress, but its achievements so far deserve recognition.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s \u201ccompete to win\u201d strategy, announced in July last year, was to refocus on its core strengths, to do so within its own, existing capital resources, and to become sustainably profitable. It aimed to become more stable, innovative, trustworthy, excellent \u2013 and relevant, to its clients, to its investors, and to society as a whole.\n\u201cHard work pays off,\u201d said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer in a note to employees, thanking them for their \u201cpassion and contribution\u201d. \u201cOur transformation is gaining traction, not just in financial terms but also in tonality and recognition from all of the bank\u2019s stakeholders\u201d, he said.\nThe bank set clear short-term and mid-term targets and accountabilities for financial and non-financial objectives through to 2022 and has achieved all of its major objectives since then.\nIt completed business exits, including cash equities trading and equity derivatives, agreed on the transfer of Global Prime Finance and has been reshaping businesses, including Rates. It has significantly reduced Risk Weighted Assets through the Capital Release Unit; is delivering significant cost reductions on target; and, despite the challenges of the coronavirus crisis, has maintained a strong capital ratio above the threshold.\nRecent landmarks have included launching the International Private Bank; merging the German legal entities; reorganising DWS; integrating the Corporate Bank in Germany; and creating a holistic Chief Risk Office function.\n\u201cDeutsche Bank is changing for the better,\u201d said Fabrizio Campelli, Management Board member and Chief Transformation Officer, who made the formal pitch for the award. \u201cThis is a different bank that is building a genuinely client-driven strategy.\u201d\nThe Chief Transformation Office was created last November to drive and support the transformation, partnering across the organisation on initiatives such as the move to a cloud platform; Fixed Income and Currencies (FIC) transformation; acceleration of the Corporate Bank\u2019s growth strategy; and infrastructure projects, including data strategy and front-to-back process reengineering.\nEuromoney\u2019s Awards for Excellence have been running since 1992 and last year attracted almost 1,500 submissions from around the world. This year\u2019s awards took into account how the winners have responded to the coronavirus crisis through their \u201cability to adapt their business to changing circumstances, provide solutions to clients, keep markets and funding channels open and protect all their stakeholders,\u201d Euromoney said.",
