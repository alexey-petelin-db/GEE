We rose to the challenge of Covid-19, providing continual market liquidity and innovation. It is terrific to be recognised as a standout among peers during this extraordinary period in history,\u201d he said.\nAsia Risk also recognised the bank\u2019s technology and culture of good communication during the pandemic.\nMarket Maker of the Year\nThe bank\u2019s stability and continual liquidity provision during the extremely volatile days of Covid-19 also won Deutsche Bank the title Market Maker of the Year.\nHead of Asia Local Markets Trading within the bank\u2019s Global Emerging Markets business, Ashok Das said: \u201cDuring the height of volatility, we continued providing clients with prices and to make markets, even when some markets closed without notice. We provided 24x5 prices for all our clients even on traditionally illiquid products like synthetic notes or structured products. That won us a lot of respect and market share.\u201d\nAsia Risk said Deutsche Bank\u2019s ability to capture market share in stressed conditions was a validation of investment in our trading architecture over previous years \u2013 combined with an obviously high level of resilience from front to back office, which helped the bank and its clients navigate the choppy waters of the Covid-19 crisis.\nDeal of the Year\nAsia Global Emerging Markets\u2019 innovative solutions won Deal of the Year for the second year in a row.\nAsia Risk was impressed by our execution of a sustainability-linked FX forward, which broke new ground for ESG finance in the Asia region. The deal showed how financial derivatives that meet clients\u2019 hedging needs can be linked to a client\u2019s performance against a set of sustainability targets, paving the way for the launch of a wider range of sustainability-linked derivative products in the future.\nAsia Head of Sustainability and Special Situations.
