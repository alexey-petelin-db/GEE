    "body": "The Covid-19 pandemic still has a foothold in countries around the world. In its aftermath, the global economy will come out of lockdown into a financial crisis. As the focus turns to rebuilding, what place will sustainable finance hold in the economy?\n\u201cPeople talk about the green revolution, and I definitely think it\u2019s coming,\u201d says Henrik Johnsson, Global Co-Head of Capital Markets. \u201cHas it only been paused by Covid-19, or will the pandemic accelerate it? I\u2019m not sure \u2013 but I am sure that it will not reverse its trajectory.\u201d\nJohnsson, who has worked in sustainable finance for the past five years, believes this revolution may be costly, but that the costs of transitioning to a green economy are balanced by its long term goals: increased prosperity, longer life spans by reducing pollution, better impacts on the environment and social progress.\n\u201cIn 2019 we saw companies and issuers of capital waking up to the fact that their social and environmental activity isn\u2019t about PR, it\u2019s about their entire business models long term,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cIf the demand for environmentally responsible investment continues to grow at this pace, a company in, let\u2019s say, the energy sector, won\u2019t be able to raise capital if it doesn\u2019t make significant ESG changes to its business model.\u201d\nHe cites coal as a clear example: big energy companies are divesting their coal assets and many investors won\u2019t invest them. Looking ahead, the same could happen to oil, power generation, combustion engines etc.\n\u201cA lot of our clients are transitioning to a low carbon footprint model, and they have to do it quickly, or they could disappear.\u201d\nThe advent of Covid-19 disrupted this transition for many clients, but Johnsson believes it will return to the forefront post pandemic, particularly as the new generation of investors re-focus on green investing.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re 25 and you\u2019re starting to save for a pension online, you\u2019ll have ten alternatives for bond funds to put your money in to \u2013 and young people consistently choose the environmentally friendly options,\u201d Johnsson says.\n\u201cThis is what I find most exciting: it\u2019s no longer about companies getting a good headline for their ESG efforts, it\u2019s about changing a company\u2019s behaviour because people really care about this topic. Not making a concerted effort to cater to the green needs of this new generation means companies risk becoming obsolete.\u201d\nDoes climate protection equal green bonds?\nTen years ago, Deutsche Bank helped the World Bank issue the first green bond. \u201cWe were a pioneer in sustainable finance, creating what was then a very specialised, niche offering that saw a maximum three or four issues per year, with relatively small volumes,\u201d Johnsson says.\nThe Swede, who joined Deutsche Bank as an intern in 2001, looks back to 2017 when Debt Capital Markets (DCM) started focusing on sustainable finance as investors discovered it was easy to raise funds that invest in green assets. \u201cSuddenly, we started seeing much more demand for green and ESG products,\u201d says Johnsson, explaining that the total amount raised by green bonds jumped from 1 billion US dollars in 2012 to 35 billion in 2014; and over 80 billion dollars raised by 2016. In 2019, global green bond issuance topped more than 190 billion dollars.\nAlongside cementing its leading position as an advisor to others, Deutsche Bank has announced plans to issue its first green bond and recently set ambitious targets to increase its volume of ESG financing, plus its portfolio of sustainable investments under management, to over 200 billion euros in total by the end of 2025.\nThis demand for green financial products has now expanded into new, financial instruments called ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) bonds, SDG (Social Development Goal) bonds and Factor bonds, which are more comprehensively aligned with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.\nA company issuing a traditional green bond would need to find a specific portfolio of green assets on the balance sheet and issue debt on those assets. The proceeds from that debt could only be used for specific projects that must be validated by a third party provider.\nHenrik Johnsson\nESG / SDG and Factor bonds, on the other hand, are not limited to specific projects but instead linked to specific climate change key performance indicators (KPIs). A company can raise as much as it wants and use it for whatever they want, as long as investors are willing to buy. But if the company misses its KPIs, it pays a financial penalty via the coupon on their debt increasing.\nDeutsche Bank issued one such bond last year for Enel, an Italian power generator that also drills for oil. The 2.5 billion US dollar bond is the first SDG from a corporate of significant scale. There is a substantial financial penalty if Enel fails to achieve the goals attached to the bond, which include creating renewable capacity of more than 55 percent in four and seven year increments.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that green bonds will become obsolete; they are good for investors in that they are measurable, trackable, and have an understandable, upfront set of criteria. However there aren\u2019t nearly enough green bonds available to satisfy investor demand, which is why there has been such a big increase in volumes of ESG and Factor bonds.\nWith more flexible instruments like these, banks and issuers can create things like Covid bonds that fund hospitals or provide essential goods to families in need. Fourteen billion US dollars of Covid bonds has been issued so far including one co-managed by Deutsche Bank for USA Capital Corporation with proceeds going towards affordable housing, renewable energy and Covid-19 relief.\n\u201cMy team and I are proud to work on ESG deals,\u201d Johnsson says. \u201cIt\u2019s also about being part of something good.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not easy being green\u2026\nThe biggest challenge in sustainable finance now is finding common KPIs that entire industries accept. \u201cLook at the oil industry \u2013 all of the oil majors are now transitioning their business models, but using different KPIs as the criteria. This makes it difficult for investors to compare the different efforts. It\u2019s not cohesive,\u201d Johnsson says.\nThat\u2019s why Deutsche Bank is working to standardise products to make it easier to analyse and compare companies \u2013 balancing this need for cohesion with the impact on the businesses. Johnsson is hopeful that ESG standardisation will become as commonplace \u2013 and as important \u2013 as credit ratings are now.\n\u201cSustainability is five or ten years behind credit ratings,\u201d he says, explaining how credit agencies came together years ago to build a framework for analysing different companies. Now, businesses need to present information in this way in order to receive a credit rating. Standardisation is the way forward for ESG, says Johnsson. \u201cIn future, when an investor buys debt, he\u2019ll consider the company\u2019s credit and ESG ratings equally. It\u2019s a work in progress, but this is where we\u2019re headed.\u201d",
