    "title": "Going GreenR \u2013 the app that promotes sustainable living and investing",
    "body": "Lorena Saenz de Alba had a good idea. What if Deutsche Bank had an app that could track clients\u2019 carbon footprints and help them save money by challenging their behaviour? And what if this app could also help those clients reinvest those extra savings in a more responsible way?\nThis idea became GreenR, a prototype developed as part of the Intrapreneur Initiative. GreenR will allow users to clearly see their personal environmental footprint. It will link directly to your Deutsche Bank accounts and translate your last six months of bank transactions\u2013 from where and what you eat, to how you move around \u2013 into how much C02 you produce.\nOnce a pattern emerges, GreenR will present a set of challenges designed to reduce your C02 footprint by, for example, helping you buy more local products, eat less meat or cycle more. For things you cannot change, like needing to fly, you can offset your carbon footprint by investing in environmental projects.\n\u201cTypically you have the option to donate to specific environmental projects to offset your C02 output. This is money you won\u2019t see again,\u201d said Saenz de Alba, a mathematician originally from Mexico. \u201cOur idea is to instead have a range of investments focused on environmental projects that, for example, help to reduce C02 or to reforest, so you\u2019re getting both an economic and an environmental return. And the money you\u2019re investing comes from the savings you\u2019ve made by making small, environmentally-friendly changes in your behaviour.\u201d\n\u201cIn our prototype, we compared the average person\u2019s footprint against their peers and found that if we continued on our current path, we would need three planets to sustain civilization,\u201d Saenz de Alba said. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have two other planets \u2013 we have to do our best to save the one we have.\u201d\nAfter joining Deutsche Bank Risk Center\u2019s Quant Institute in 2015, Saenz de Alba moved to Frankfurt two years later, where she is now a Treasury Manager for DWS.\nThrough networking with colleagues in Wealth Management and the Private Bank, Saenz de Alba discovered the Intraprenuer Initiative. Typically, colleagues are recruited and given an idea to develop but she took matters into her own hands, pitching her own idea to the Initiative\u2019s board, which liked it enough to recruit five additional people, plus a coach, to design and create it in October 2019. She also received her manager\u2019s blessing to devote 50 percent of her time to the Initiative for six months although, she said it was \u201cmore like 100 percent for both jobs.\u201d\nThe team shaped the idea through Agile methodology, interviewed more than 100 people in and outside the bank to gauge interest in the app, and conducted the first sprint - a short, time-constrained period when a team works to complete a set amount of work - during which they created a road map for how the app would work.\nThey then had four weeks to determine legal, compliance and technology requirements, identify potential clients and create a marketing strategy. In the second sprint, they worked with a tech team and project managers to narrow down the idea and shape it into a more tangible, creative prototype that they had to present in a five minute pitch to the Venture Board made up of Christian Sewing, Asoka Woehrmann, Christiana Riley, Frank Kuhnke, Manfred Knof, Bernd Leukert and an external angel investor.\n\u201cTypically only half of the six teams that present each year are approved to move forward, so it was a very intense five minutes,\u201d said Saenz de Alba . \u201cWe were thrilled when they gave us their approval and excited to move into the incubation phase. Then Covid-19 hit.\u201d\nThe pandemic turned the team\u2019s progress on its head. Employees\u2019 priorities shifted, as did those of the bank, which was more focused on moving as much as possible to a digital platform so people could continue to work. Innovation could wait.\n\u201cWe had a lot of difficult discussions,\u201d Saenz de Alba said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t postpone the incubation period because we had committed to returning to our jobs by a specific time. We had to continue developing, but we couldn\u2019t meet in person, and people had more pressing issues to focus on.\u201d\nSaenz de Alba understands that, with higher levels of uncertainty due to the pandemic, it will take longer to align decisions on innovation; but she also believes Deutsche Bank is committed to sustainability, and she hopes that her team will have good news soon.\n\u201cGreenR isn\u2019t just about getting people to invest in our products and being more environmentally conscious, it\u2019s also a rare opportunity to understand the needs of this generation and to learn from them,\u201d said Saenz de Alba. \u201cDigital on-demand services are part of this generation\u2019s DNA, and digital banking products are becoming more popular also. If Deutsche Bank can be a part of this evolution, we can strengthen the close relationships we have with our clients.\"\n\u201cBeing able to offer services like GreenR will help us attract more of those clients that we\u2019re not reaching at the moment \u2013 and help us become even more relevant to this specific client segment.\u201d",
