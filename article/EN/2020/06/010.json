    "title": "Deutsche Bank updates Common Equity Tier 1 ratio",
    "body": "Frankfurt am Main, July 21, 2020 \u2013 13:29 CEST \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) estimates its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio as of June 30, 2020, to be approximately 13.3% compared to 12.8% at March 31, 2020. This is above market expectations and prior management guidance.\nThe increase in the CET1 ratio in the second quarter is principally driven by lower than anticipated credit risk weighted assets (RWAs). The lower RWAs reflect lower loan balances driven by higher than expected repayments of credit facilities by clients, notably in the later part of the quarter, and a reduction of derivative volumes. The client facilities were initially drawn in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic economic challenges and subsequently repaid or refinanced.\nDeutsche Bank expects results for the second quarter of 2020 to be slightly above average consensus estimates as compiled by the company on July 21, 2020. Full details of Deutsche Bank\u2019s second quarter results will be released as scheduled on July 29, 2020 at approximately 07:00 CET.\nDeutsche Bank AG\nTaunusanlage 12\n60325 Frankfurt am Main\nGermany\nISIN: DE0005140008\nWKN: 514000\nListed: Regulated market in Berlin-Bremen, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt (Prime Standard), Hamburg, Hanover, Munich und Stuttgart; EUREX; NYSE\nThe International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) of further financial instruments issued by Deutsche Bank AG, and admitted to trading on a domestic organized market or for which such admission has been applied for, are listed in the attached PDFs.",
