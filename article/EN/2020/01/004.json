    "body": "Deutsche Bank AG has successfully launched the first Sustainable Development Note in Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) for issuer Inter-American Development Bank (IDB or IADB), rated Aaa/ AAA (Moody\u2019s/S&P).\nIDB raised the equivalent of 100 million US dollars by pricing the Sustainable Development Notes denominated in IDR, with a three-year maturity and an annual coupon of 5.50%.\nProceeds of the Sustainable Development Notes will support IDB\u2019s strategic priorities to reduce poverty and inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean by promoting economic and social development in a sustainable, climate friendly way. Each strategic priority of IDB aligns to at least one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThis is the first time Deutsche Bank has priced Sustainable Development Notes in an Asian local currency.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Head of Asia Local Markets Trading and Solutions, Ashok Das said: \u201cWe are proud to have structured the first Sustainable Development Notes denominated in Indonesian Rupiah. The offer was very well received by real money investors in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific where there is continued demand for investments in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) theme.\n\u201cInvestors with ESG mandates are rallying to support development banks with clear strategic priorities linked to Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d Das said. \u201cWith demand strong and attractive pricing terms, it\u2019s a good time for development banks to finance.\u201d\nThe Notes support the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals linked to IDB\u2019s mission which focuses on three challenges involving social inclusion and equality (SDGs 1,2,3,4,6, 10), productivity and innovation (SDGs 4, 7, 8, 9) and economic integration (SDGs 8,9,17).\nIDB Head of Funding Laura Fan said: \u201cIDB is pleased to issue our first ever Sustainable Development Bond denominated in Indonesian Rupiah. IADB has now issued Sustainable Development Bonds in seven different currencies and we hope to grow this number in 2020 due to strong investor demand for socially responsible investments.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank AG acted as sole dealer and structured the Sustainable Development Notes in Asian local currency format.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\nDeutsche Bank AG\nMedia Relations\nSarah Stabler\nPhone: +65 6423 8413\nE-mail: sarah.stabler@db.com\n\nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides commercial and investment banking, retail banking, transaction banking and asset and wealth management products and services to corporations, governments, institutional investors, small and medium-sized businesses, and private individuals.
