    "title": "Record demand for Deutsche Bank\u2019s senior debt issue",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank today launched a dual tranche of senior non-preferred debt instruments for a tenor of 5 and 10 years, callable after 4 and 9 years respectively. The order book, of close to 10 billion euros, was the largest ever for any Deutsche Bank senior debt instrument. These euro-denominated issuances will raise a total of 3 billion euros with a coupon of 160 basis points over mid-swap for the 5 year tenure and 210 basis points over mid-swap for the 10 year instrument.\nWith our 2020 external funding plan largely complete, the proceeds of this issuance will be used to pre-fund the 2021 requirements, as we explained on last week\u2019s third-quarter Fixed Income Investor Call. This will strengthen our position in respect of Total Loss Absorption Capacity (TLAC) and Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL).\nThis issuance follows a positive market reaction to our third quarter results. Last week, Moody\u2019s announced its decision to raise the outlook on Deutsche Bank\u2019s credit ratings from negative to stable \u2013 the first positive move on Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings since May 2007. Following this upgrade, spreads on Deutsche Bank\u2019s five year euro senior non-preferred bond tightened by 26 basis points over the course of last week, enabling Deutsche Bank to issue at more favorable rates.\nIn its report, Moody\u2019s commented on the strength of Deutsche Bank\u2019s liquidity and funding: \u201cIn addition to its solid capitalization, high liquidity remains a comparative, credit-positive strength of DB. The bank reported liquidity reserves of 253 billion euros as of 30 September 2020, which substantially mitigates the refinancing risks associated with its more confidence-sensitive wholesale market funding.\u201d\nDixit Joshi, Group Treasurer said: \u201cRecord demand for this issue, following our successful issuances earlier in the year, is another sign of growing market confidence in Deutsche Bank. Following last week\u2019s upgrade from Moody\u2019s and with the US election behind us, our timing worked well. This enables us to manage our future funding requirements well and further strengthen Deutsche Bank\u2019s balance sheet.\u201d",
