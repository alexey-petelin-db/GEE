    "body": "Dear Colleagues,\nIn October 2015, we announced that Henry Ritchotte would leave the Management Board to pursue plans to set up a new digital bank for Deutsche Bank.\nSince that time, Henry and a small number of colleagues have developed an excellent blueprint for launching a digital banking service in the United States.\nDespite the quality of the blueprint, the Management Board has decided not to pursue building a digital banking service in the US at this time. Doing so would require us to divert resources from our core strategy of further focusing and innovating the Bank\u2019s offerings to clients and re-building its infrastructure. We are determined to implement several ideas generated by Henry and his team in our business divisions.\nIn the coming weeks, Henry and I will discuss plans to redeploy his team into our existing businesses. We are grateful to Henry and his team for their excellent work.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Cryan",
