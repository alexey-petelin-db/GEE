    "title": "Deutsche Bank announces successful completion of public tender offer",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE/ NYSE: DB) announced the successful completion of the tender offers to repurchase up to 3 billion euros of five euro-denominated and up to 2 billion US dollars of eight US dollar-denominated senior unsecured debt securities. Deutsche Bank had launched the tender offers on 12 February 2016.\nThe two tender offers resulted in a repurchase of euro-denominated bonds with a notional value of 1.27 billion euros and of US dollar-denominated bonds with a notional value of 0.74 billion US dollars, equating to a total volume of 1.94 billion euros. During the last ten working days of the offer period for US dollar-denominated bonds investors tendered securities with a notional value of less than 1 million US dollars.\nThe relatively low investor participation in these public tender offers reflects improved market sentiment and an investor preference to retain exposure to Deutsche Bank.\nDeutsche Bank expects to record a gain in the first-quarter 2016 of approximately 55 million euros from the repurchase of the securities.\nFurther details can be found on Deutsche Bank\u2019s Investor Relations website under https://www.db.com/ir.",
