    "title": "Ending China's differential treatment",
    "body": "When China joined the WTO in 2001, its accession protocol included an option for members to apply alternative methodologies when assessing dumping for Chinese imports. As parts of the provisions are set to expire in December 2016, the future approach to determine dumping in investigations concerning China in the EU has come under debate.\nThere are several options on the table: They range from sticking to the status quo to allowing for full market economy treatment.\nThe outcome matters for both European and Chinese industries and could have potential ramifications on China-EU trade relations. The European Commission therefore has to walk a tightrope taking into account the concerns of the different market participants affected as well as member states, which have often held divergent positions on anti-dumping in the past.",
