The loans were originated through Zopa which is an online P2P platform connecting individual borrowers and lenders.\nIt is the first time in Europe that consumer loans originated on a P2P platform have been publicly securitized and opens up a new source of funding for other potential institutional investors. Zopa is the most established P2P platform in Europe having been in operation since 2004 and has originated over \u00a31.6bn loans to date.\nDeutsche Bank was the Sole Arranger on the deal which received a strong reception from investors with all three tranches on offer being well oversubscribed.\nEarlier this year, Deutsche Bank arranged the first European securitization of SME loans from a P2P platform: a \u00a3130 million transaction of loans originated by Funding Circle.\nThe two transactions demonstrate Deutsche Bank\u2019s leadership in this fast-growing part of the structured finance market.",
