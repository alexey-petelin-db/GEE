The Fed examines designated CRA wholesale banks and grants evaluations based on the banks\u2019 community development activities\nDeutsche Bank earned the \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating based on several factors, including the Bank\u2019s high volume of qualified CRA community development loans totaling USD 1.2 billion, the Bank\u2019s expert ability to provide innovative loans and ability to engage in complex structures that are not routinely available in the marketplace, Deutsche Bank\u2019s excellent responsiveness to credit and community development needs in the New York City metro area, as well as inventive philanthropic initiatives.\nThe Bank\u2019s commitment goes well beyond the mandated requirements, consistently earning Deutsche Bank its \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating from the Fed for its CRA performance over the past 22 years. Deutsche Bank also has a long history of engaging with New York nonprofit organizations, and working in trusted partnerships with local and state government agencies.
