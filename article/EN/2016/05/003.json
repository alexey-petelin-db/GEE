    "title": "John Cryan statement on the UK's EU referendum result",
    "body": "\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe. At this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there\u2019s no doubt that they will be negative on all sides. As a bank headquartered in Germany and with a strong presence in the UK, we are well prepared. However, there\u2019s no doubt that the uncertainty created by the referendum\u2019s results will be a challenge.\nLet me add a personal note: I am a strong supporter of the European project, which has brought peace and prosperity for more than 50 years. As a Briton and a European, it especially saddens me that Europe has obviously lost its attractiveness for many of my fellow countrymen. It\u2019s a clear signal to the EU to get closer to its people and to strengthen democracy.\u201d\nJohn Cryan\u2019s statement is also available as a video.\nHigh resolution audio (mp3) and video files (mov) are available on request.",
