    "body": "Dear Colleagues,\nIn mid-April I wrote to you about Quintin Price, Head of Deutsche Asset Management, who had informed us that he required a period of medical leave.\nAfter consulting further with his doctors since that time, Quintin has now informed us that he will be unable to reassume his role and return to Deutsche Bank.\nQuintin remains focused on his treatment plan, and I know that you will join me in wishing him well and in thanking him for his contributions since joining us in 2015.\nThe Supervisory Board has begun to search for a successor to lead Deutsche Asset Management. In the meantime, Jon Eilbeck, Global Chief Operating Officer and Regional Head for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Asset Management, will continue to lead operational responsibilities for the business, and I will continue to represent Asset Management on the Management Board in accordance with the Bank\u2019s business allocation plan.\nI am grateful for your ongoing commitment and focus during this period of transition.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Cryan",
