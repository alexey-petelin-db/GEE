    "body": "Deutsche Bank was voted No. 1 All-America Sales Team with clients this year for research sales, leaping to first from fourth place in the Institutional Investor survey.\n\u201cThe majority of our sales leadership across the country has been at Deutsche Bank for more than a decade. That kind of continuity is powerful and helps reinforce our sales culture,\u201d said Craig Bench, Co-Head of Americas Equities Distribution.\nIn Institutional Investor\u2019s article, Bench pointed out that Deutsche Bank\u2019s sales operation is attempting to communicate more effectively across its broader equity business.\n\u201cOur derivatives, prime finance and execution sales teams maintain a regular dialogue with our advisory sales team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also begun to be more coordinated with our peers in fixed income, something that banks across the Street have historically struggled with. Our improved coordination has yielded tangible benefits for our clients.\u201d\nIn addition, the 2016 All-America Research Team survey rankings were published.\nRod Lache (Auto & Auto Parts), Matt O\u2019Connor (Large Cap Banks) and Josh Shanker (P&C Insurance) earned distinction with 1st team finishes.\n\u201cWe continue to show that Deutsche Bank is a platform where people can grow organically and build a top tier franchise,\u201d said Steve Pollard, Global Head of Equity Research.",
