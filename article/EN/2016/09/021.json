The event theme, \u201cClassroom to Boardroom,\u201d will be highlighted through technology showcases, key notes and a panel discussion.

I hope that each attendee leaves Women\u2019s Leadership Day with a connection to at least one person they didn't know before, and at least one idea to act on when returning to their offices.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to the Girl Scout Research Institute, 77 percent of girls say that, because of Girl Scouts, they are considering a career in STEM, and partnerships like this provide critical experience and guidance in STEM-related fields,\u201d said Mary Anne Jacobs, CEO of Girl Scouts of Gateway Council. \u201cThrough STEM programs, girls tend to persevere, become resourceful problem-solvers, challenge-seekers and promoters of cooperation and team-building, and they feel empowered to make a difference in the world \u2014 all qualities of strong leaders.\u201d\nThe afternoon session features a panel discussion moderated by Deborah Gianoulis Heald, President and CEO of the Schultz Center for Teaching and Leadership.
