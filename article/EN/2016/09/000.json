    "title": "Deutsche Bank confirms negotiations with DoJ regarding RMBS",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank AG (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) confirms that it has commenced negotiations with the Department of Justice in the United States (\u201cDoJ\u201d) with a view to seeking to settle civil claims that the DoJ may consider in connection with the bank\u2019s issuance and underwriting of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and related securitization activities between 2005 and 2007.\nThe bank confirms market speculation of an opening position by the DoJ of USD 14 billion and that the DoJ has invited the bank as the next step to submit a counter proposal.\nDeutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.",
