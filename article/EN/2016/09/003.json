This and other important information can be found in the Fund\u2019s prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-855-DBX-ETFS (1-855-329-3837) or by viewing or downloading a prospectus at www.deutsche-etfs.com. Please read it carefully before investing.\nInvesting involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.\nInvesting involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Stocks may decline in value. Foreign investing involves greater and different risks than investing in US companies, including currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards.\nEmerging markets tend to be more volatile and less liquid than the markets of more mature economies and generally have less diverse and less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than those of developed countries. Funds investing in a single industry, country or in a limited geographic region generally are more volatile than more diversified funds.\nBecause the fund seeks to provide exposure to stocks based on the following multifactors \u2013 value, momentum, quality, low volatility and size \u2013 it is expected exposure to such investment factors will detract from performance in some market environments, as more fully explained in the fund\u2019s prospectus. Performance of the Fund may diverge from that of the Underlying Index due to operating expenses, transaction costs, cash flows, use of sampling strategies or operational inefficiencies.\nAn investment in any fund should be considered only as a supplement to a complete investment program for those investors willing to accept the risks associated with that fund. See the prospectus for details.\nShares are not individually redeemable, and owners of Shares may acquire those Shares from the Fund, or tender such Shares for redemption to the Fund, in Creation Units only.\nDBX Advisors LLC is the investment adviser to the Deutsche X-trackers Funds.
