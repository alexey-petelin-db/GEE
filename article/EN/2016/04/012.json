    "body": "At Frieze New York, more than 200 international galleries, from A Gentil Carioca (Rio de Janeiro) to Zwirner (New York/London), give insight into current art from around the world. While Herald St (London) is showing new works by Markus Amm, Ramin & Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian have transformed the booth of Gallery Isabelle van den Eynde (Dubai) into wildly sprawling installations typical of the art collective.\nHunt Kastner (Prague) is presenting Basim Magdy, who currently has a solo show at theDeutsche Bank KunstHalle. Frieze visitors can also experience the Deutsche Bank \u201cArtist of the Year\u201d 2016 live. In the Reading Room, a new space where the world\u2019s leading art publications are presented, Magdy talks with Omar Kholeif, Senior Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.\nOf course Deutsche Bank is also present at the Frieze New York, showing a selection of works by Xaviera Simmons.\nLike the London fair Frieze New York brings out its own edition of \u201cFrieze Week\u201d, an exclusive magazine reporting on exciting exhibitions in museums and art spaces in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, as well as on the Frieze art fair itself.\nFrieze New York\n05/05/2016 \u2013 05/08/2016\nRandall\u2018s Island Park\n(Photo: Marco Scozzaro, Courtesy: Marco Scozzaro/Frieze)",
