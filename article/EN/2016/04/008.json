    "body": "\u201cThe election is something that\u2019s clearly on people\u2019s minds. In the distant past, the election typically was not a big factor impacting investor or, for that matter, corporate decision making, but what we noticed back in 2012 was the slowing in the pace of capital expenditures by firms in anticipation of those 2012 election results. With the economy not doing that much better this year in terms of growth, the uncertainty regarding the election, who wins, what those policies will look like, will likely keep investment spending at bay.\u201d \u2013 Joseph LaVorgna",
