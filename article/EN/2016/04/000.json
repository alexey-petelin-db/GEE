    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) announced today that it will freeze plans to create 250 new jobs at its Cary, North Carolina, location.\nThe Bank\u2019s decision is due to state-wide legislation enacted in North Carolina on March 23 that invalidated existing protections of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender fellow citizens in some municipalities and prevents municipalities from adopting such protections in the future.\nJohn Cryan, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWe take our commitment to building inclusive work environments seriously. We\u2019re proud of our operations and employees in Cary and regret that as a result of this legislation we are unwilling to include North Carolina in our US expansion plans for now. We very much hope that we can re-visit our plans to grow this location in the near future.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank currently employs approximately 900 people at its software application development center in Cary and is committed to sustaining that existing presence.\nOn 22 September 2015, Deutsche Bank confirmed plans to add 250 jobs in Cary through 2017.",
