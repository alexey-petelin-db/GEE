During his tenure as a Member of the Management Board he has played a major role in re-establishing Deutsche Bank as a profitable and credible institution. Over the past few years, he has very successfully positioned the Private Bank for efficiency and growth. The Supervisory Board welcomes the fact that he will serve out his contract, which runs until the end of October. We thank him sincerely for his service and wish him every success in his future career.\u201c\nChristian Sewing, CEO of Deutsche Bank said: \u201cI respect Karl\u2019s decision to leave Deutsche Bank after more than a quarter of a century to pursue new endeavours.

In the past eight years, and for the last five years as President on the Board, Karl has been a strong and very trusted partner who was instrumental to our successful transformation. His dedication and collaboration are second to none and I look forward to another sixth months to jointly make Deutsche Bank even stronger.\u201d\nKarl von Rohr said: \u201cAfter eight years on the Management Board and the successful completion of so many important steps of Deutsche Bank\u2019s transformation, this is the right time for me to pursue new endeavours. I have found it deeply fulfilling to do my part in helping the institution return to a solid foundation that enables profitable growth \u2013 especially in the German home market. None of this would have been possible without so many colleagues throughout the bank who have been part of my journey. My sincere gratitude goes to them. Until my contract expires in October, I will remain fully committed to supporting Deutsche Bank\u2019s continued success.\u201d\nVon Rohr joined Deutsche Bank in 1997.
