    "body": "Nine-month profit before tax up 3%, reflecting revenue growth and cost discipline\nNet revenues up 6% year on year to \u20ac 22.2 billion\nNoninterest expenses up 7% to \u20ac 16.2 billion including nonoperating costs1 of \u20ac 943 million\nAdjusted costs\u00b9 up 2% to \u20ac 15.3 billion despite inflation pressures\nPost-tax profit of \u20ac 3.5 billion, down 6%, reflecting a higher tax rate\nPost-tax return on tangible equity (RoTE)\u00b9 of 7%; cost/income ratio of 73%\nAdjusted post-tax RoTE\u00b9 of 9% and cost/income ratio of 68%\nNet inflows of \u20ac 39 billion across the Private Bank and Asset Management\nStrong capital management and enhanced capital outlook support business growth as well as acceleration and expansion of distribution goals\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio rises to 13.9% after absorbing regulatory impacts of 38 basis points (bps) and share buybacks\nScope to free up additional ~ \u20ac 3 billion of capital from increased RWA reduction potential and updated Basel III estimates through 2025\nCapital distributions reach \u20ac 1.6 billion over 2022 and first nine months of 2023\nThird-quarter profit before tax of \u20ac 1.7 billion, up 7% year on year\nPost-tax profit of \u20ac 1.2 billion, down 3%, reflecting a higher tax rate\nPost-tax RoTE\u00b9 of 7.3% and cost/income ratio of 72%\nFurther revenue growth and asset inflows in the third quarter\nNet revenues up 3% year on year to \u20ac 7.1 billion\nNet inflows of \u20ac 11 billion across the Private Bank and Asset Management\nFull year 2023 revenue expectation of ~ \u20ac 29 billion\nContinued cost discipline in the quarter\nNoninterest expenses of \u20ac 5.2 billion, up 4% year on year\nAdjusted costs\u00b9 up 2% to \u20ac 5.0 billion despite inflation pressures\nProgress on operational efficiency with further measures underway\nStrong risk and balance sheet management in the quarter\nProvision for credit losses of \u20ac 245 million, 20 bps of average loans\nDeposits rise by \u20ac 18 billion to \u20ac 611 billion\nLiquidity coverage ratio of 132%, a surplus of \u20ac 51 billion\nThese results demonstrate strong and sustained business growth momentum combined with continued cost discipline. Furthermore, we have materially improved our capital outlook thanks to our strong results and focused capital efficiency measures. This gives us scope to invest in growing our Global Hausbank model, further improve returns, and increase and accelerate distributions to our shareholders. \nChristian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer\nDeutsche Bank (XETRA: DBGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today announced profit before tax of \u20ac 1.7 billion for the third quarter of 2023, up 7% compared to the third quarter of 2022 and the highest for any third quarter since 2006.\nThird quarter post-tax profit was \u20ac 1.2 billion, down 3% compared to the prior year quarter. The year-on-year development reflected an effective tax rate of 30% in the quarter, compared to 23% in the prior year quarter which benefited from the geographical mix of income. \nPost-tax RoTE\u00b9 was 7.3%, compared to 8.2% in the third quarter of 2022. Post-tax return on average shareholders\u2019 equity (RoE) was 6.5%, down from 7.4% in the prior year quarter. The year-on-year development in both ratios primarily reflected the higher tax rate, increased total equity due to organic capital generation, and higher Additional Tier 1 (AT1) coupons compared to the prior year quarter. These effects more than offset the positive impact of growth in profit before tax. The cost/income ratio was 72%, unchanged from the prior year quarter.\nFor the first nine months, profit before tax was \u20ac 5.0 billion, up 3% year on year, after absorbing nonoperating costs of \u20ac 943 million, up from \u20ac 170 million in the first nine months of 2022. Excluding nonoperating costs, profit before tax would have been \u20ac 5.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, up 19% from \u20ac 5.0 billion in the prior year period. Post-tax profit in the first nine months was \u20ac 3.5 billion, down 6% year on year; the year-on-year development reflected higher nonoperating costs and an effective tax rate of 30%, compared to 24% in the prior year period. \nPost-tax RoTE\u00b9 for the first nine months was 7.0%, compared to 8.1% in the prior year period, and post-tax RoE was 6.3%, down from 7.2% in the prior year period. The year-on-year development in both ratios reflected the aforementioned rises in the tax rate, total equity, and AT1 coupons compared to the prior year period. The cost/income ratio was 73%, unchanged year on year.\nJames von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, said: \u201cOur progress on capital efficiency, and on scoping future regulatory requirements, give us much greater clarity on our potential to free up additional capital. With better visibility on revenue growth, strong risk management and continued cost control, we\u2019re increasingly confident that we can accelerate our growth and shareholder return strategies despite the uncertainties in the environment.\u201d      \nAssuming an equal apportionment of bank levies and excluding nonoperating costs, post-tax RoTE\u00b9 would have been 8.8%, up from 8.7% in the first nine months of 2022. Post-tax RoE would have been 7.9%, up from 7.8% in the prior year period. The cost/income ratio would have been 68%, down from 71% in the prior year period.\nProgress on accelerated execution of the Global Hausbank strategy\nDeutsche Bank made progress in accelerating execution of its Global Hausbank strategy on all dimensions during the quarter. In summary:\nRevenue growth: Deutsche Bank delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 6% in the first nine months of 2023, and a compound annual growth rate over 2021 of 6.9% in the twelve months to September 30, 2023, above the bank\u2019s target of 3.5% \u2013 4.5%, and the bank expects full-year 2023 revenues of around \u20ac 29 billon. The bank made further strategic investments in capital-efficient and fee income-generating businesses and completed the acquisition of Numis, the UK corporate broker, in early October 2023. The Private Bank and Asset Management together attracted \u20ac 39 billion in net inflows in the first nine months of 2023, which drove growth in assets under management of \u20ac 66 billion across the two businesses in this period.\nOperational efficiency: Deutsche Bank aims for incremental operational efficiencies of \u20ac 2.5 billion annually, predominantly by 2025. Key initiatives are largely running in line with or ahead of plan, headcount reduction measures in senior non-client-facing staff have been completed and further workforce efficiency measures are in place. Further measures underway include streamlining front-to-back processes and optimization of the distribution network; the number of branches has been reduced by 93 in the first nine months of 2023.  \nCapital efficiency: Around \u20ac 10 billion of Deutsche Bank\u2019s 2025 RWA optimization target of \u20ac 15-20 billion was already achieved by the end of the third quarter, without material impact on revenues. Progress included data and process enhancements and an additional securitisation transaction during the quarter; additional portfolio measures are in progress, including optimized hedging and reductions in sub-hurdle lending. Given progress to date and further reduction potential, the bank has identified scope to increase its RWA reduction target by \u20ac 10 billion, to \u20ac 25-30 billion. Additionally, the bank\u2019s latest analysis indicates that the impact on RWA from the implementation of Basel III requirements will be \u20ac 10-15 billion lower than originally estimated. Taken together, these factors create potential to free up additional capital of around \u20ac 3 billion through 2025.\nRevenues: outperforming strategic targets\nNet revenues were \u20ac 7.1 billion, up 3% year on year, and up 6% if adjusted for specific items. These items included the non-recurrence of prior year positive impacts from workout activities related to Sal. Oppenheim in the Private Bank, and a lower benefit from debt valuation adjustments (DVAs) in the Investment Bank. For the first nine months, net revenues were \u20ac 22.2 billion, up 6%, and up 8% ex-specific items.\nRevenue development by business was as follows:\nCorporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 1.9 billion in the third quarter, up 21% year on year. All segments delivered double-digit year-on-year growth, driven by strong net interest income and continued pricing discipline. Revenues in Corporate Treasury Services were up 11% to \u20ac 1.0 billion, Institutional Client Services revenues rose 18% to \u20ac 472 million, and Business Banking revenues grew 71% to \u20ac 369 million. Deposits increased by \u20ac 15 billion to \u20ac 286 billion during the quarter. For the first nine months, net revenues were up 27% to \u20ac 5.8 billion. Corporate Treasury Services revenues were up 19% to \u20ac 3.3 billion, Institutional Client Services revenues rose 23% to \u20ac 1.4 billion, and Business Banking revenues rose 69% to \u20ac 1.1 billion. Deutsche Bank was named \u2018Best Bank for Cash Management\u2019 and Transaction Bank of the Year for Western Europe\u2019 in The Banker\u2019s 2023 Transaction Banking Awards.\nInvestment Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.3 billion in the quarter, down 4% year on year and essentially flat if adjusted for the aforementioned reduction in DVA benefit to \u20ac 5 million, down from \u20ac 91 million in the prior year quarter. FIC Sales & Trading (FIC) revenues were \u20ac 1.9 billion, down 12% from the exceptional levels of the prior year quarter. Revenues in Rates, Foreign Exchange, Emerging Markets and Financing were lower compared to an unusually strong prior year quarter, while revenues in Credit Trading were significantly higher, driven by improvements in flow business and strong performance in Distressed. Origination & Advisory revenues were \u20ac 323 million, up more than three-fold year-on-year, and up 56% if adjusted for the non-recurrence of leveraged lending markdowns in the prior year quarter. Leveraged Debt Capital Markets saw a year-on-year recovery in market share which more than offset year-on-year revenue declines in Investment Grade Debt and Advisory revenues, both reflecting a lower industry fee pool (source: Dealogic). For the first nine months, net revenues were \u20ac 7.3 billion, down 12%. Revenues in FIC were \u20ac 6.4 billion, down 13%, while revenues in Origination & Advisory grew 17% to \u20ac 941 million. Deutsche Bank was named \u2018Best Global FX Provider\u2019 in the Euromoney FX Awards for 2023.\nPrivate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.3 billion in the quarter, up 3% year on year and up 9% if adjusted for the non-recurrence of Sal. Oppenheim workout activities in the prior year quarter. Higher revenues from deposit products, driven by higher net interest margins, more than offset lower fee income, lower loan revenues and the negative year-on-year impact of FX movements. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany grew 16% to \u20ac 1.5 billion. Revenues in the International Private Bank were down 13% to \u20ac 845 million, or up 2% if adjusted for the non-recurrence of \u20ac 110 million in revenues from Sal. Oppenheim workout activities and of approximately \u20ac 15 million from Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors in Italy, divested in the fourth quarter of 2022, together with negative FX impacts of around \u20ac 20 million. Assets under Management rose by \u20ac 5 billion to \u20ac 547 billion during the quarter, as net inflows of \u20ac 9 billion and positive FX movements of \u20ac 3 billion more than offset a negative impact of \u20ac 7 billion from lower market levels. For the first nine months, net revenues were up 8% to \u20ac 7.2 billion, and up 10% if adjusted for the non-recurrence of \u20ac 119 million in revenues from Sal. Oppenheim workout activities in the prior year period. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany rose 15% to \u20ac 4.6 billion. Revenues in the International Private Bank were \u20ac 2.6 billion, down 3%, or up 4% if adjusted for the aforementioned non-recurrence of prior year revenues from Sal. Oppenheim workout activities and of approximately \u20ac 50 million from Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors, together with negative FX movements of \u20ac 15 million. Assets under Management were \u20ac 547 billion, up by \u20ac 28 billion in the first nine months, driven largely by net inflows of \u20ac 22 billion.\nAsset Management net revenues were \u20ac 594 million in the third quarter, down 10% year on year. This development principally reflected lower performance fees, the mark-to-market of co-investments and FX movements. Assets under management rose slightly to \u20ac 860 billion during the quarter; net inflows of \u20ac 2 billion, driven by Passive, and favorable FX movements more than offset the impact of lower market valuations. For the first nine months, net revenues were \u20ac 1.8 billion, down 10% compared to the first nine months of 2022, reflecting lower management fees and significantly lower investment income. Assets under management grew by \u20ac 38 billion in the first nine months, compared to a decline of \u20ac 94 billion in the first nine months of 2022; net inflows were \u20ac 17 billion, compared to net outflows of \u20ac 18 billion in the prior year period.\nNoninterest expenses: modest rises in adjusted costs\nNoninterest expenses were \u20ac 5.2 billion in the third quarter, up 4% year on year. This development partly reflected nonoperating costs of \u20ac 199 million, up from \u20ac 75 million in the prior year quarter, comprising \u20ac 105 million in litigation charges relating mainly to longstanding matters and \u20ac 94 million in restructuring and severance relating to accelerated execution of the bank\u2019s Global Hausbank strategy. Adjusted costs, which exclude these items, were \u20ac 5.0 billion, up 2%, below the rate of inflation despite the cumulative impact of investments in business growth, technology and controls in recent periods, partly offset by favorable FX movements.\nFor the first nine months, noninterest expenses were \u20ac 16.2 billion, up 7%. The year-on-year increase was driven by nonoperating costs of \u20ac 943 million, up from \u20ac 170 million in the first nine months of 2022. Adjusted costs were \u20ac 15.2 billion, up 2% from the prior year period, or 3% excluding FX movements, despite continued investments and inflationary headwinds.\nThe workforce rose by 2,204 internal full-time equivalents (FTEs) to 89,260 during the quarter. This development reflected strategic hiring, graduates joining during the quarter and the ongoing internalisation of external FTEs, partly offset by leavers related to operational efficiency measures during the quarter.\nCredit provisions remain in line with full-year guidance\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 245 million in the third quarter, down from \u20ac 401 million in the second quarter. Performing (stage 1 and 2) loans saw provision releases of \u20ac 101 million, reflecting model changes and improved macroeconomic forecasts for the US which primarily impact the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank. Provision for non-performing (stage 3) loans was \u20ac 346 million, up slightly from \u20ac 338 million in the previous quarter.\nFor the first nine months, provision for credit losses was \u20ac 1.0 billion, or 28 bps of average loans. For the full year 2023, Deutsche Bank reaffirms its expectation for provision for credit losses to be at the upper end of its communicated range of 25-30 bps.\nStrong capital management\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.9% at the end of the third quarter, up from 13.8% at the end of the second quarter, and substantially above the bank\u2019s 2025 capital objective of around 13%. This development reflected the positive impacts of organic capital generation from net income, benefits from data and process optimization as part of the bank\u2019s capital efficiency measures, and lower credit risk RWAs. These more than offset a negative impact of 38 bps from regulatory changes, in line with guidance and predominantly reflecting the first-time recognition of newly-approved wholesale and retail models, and the negative impact of deductions for share buybacks and dividends.\nThe Leverage ratio was 4.7% in the quarter, in line with the previous quarter. The positive impact of a \u20ac 1 billion reduction in leverage exposure to \u20ac 1,235 billion was offset by the Tier 1 capital change in line with a CET1 capital movement during the quarter.\nShare repurchases during the quarter amounted to approximately 27.5 million shares for a total consideration of approximately \u20ac 271 million, just over 60% of the \u20ac 450 million anticipated by year-end 2023 as announced on July 25, 2023. This brought total distributions to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends, to approximately \u20ac 1.57 billion through the full year 2022 and the first nine months of 2023, well on track towards the bank\u2019s targets for total distributions of over \u20ac 1 billion in 2023 and \u20ac 1.75 billion over 2022 and 2023, with further buybacks anticipated in 2024.\nLiquidity and funding strength\nLiquidity reserves were \u20ac 245 billion at the end of the third quarter, up slightly from \u20ac 244 billion at the end of the second quarter, including High Quality Liquid Assets of \u20ac 210 billion. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 132%, above the regulatory requirement of 100%, representing a surplus of \u20ac 51 billion. The Net Stable Funding Ratio was 121%, slightly above the bank\u2019s target range of 115-120% and representing a surplus of \u20ac 105 billion above required levels.\nDeposits grew by \u20ac 18 billion to \u20ac 611 billion during the quarter, driven largely by the aforementioned growth of \u20ac 15 billion in Corporate Bank deposits.    \nSustainable Finance: further progress toward targets\nEnvironment, Social and Governance (ESG)-related financing and investment volumes\u00b2 were \u20ac 11 billion ex-DWS in the quarter, bringing the cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 265 billion, including \u20ac 50 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Deutsche Bank aims for a cumulative total of over \u20ac 500 billion ex-DWS by the end of 2025.\nIn the third quarter, Deutsche Bank\u2019s businesses contributed as follows:\nCorporate Bank: \u20ac 3 billion in sustainable financing, raising the Corporate Bank\u2019s cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to \u20ac 50 billion.\nInvestment Bank: \u20ac 7 billion in sustainable financing and capital market issuance, for a cumulative total of \u20ac 159 billion since January 1, 2020.\n \u20ac 1 billion growth in ESG assets under management and new client lending, and a cumulative total of \u20ac 56 billion since January 1, 2020\nOn October 19, 2023, Deutsche Bank published its initial Transition Plan, outlining the bank\u2019s progress to date and future roadmap for achieving net zero emissions by 2050. This publication covers the bank\u2019s strategy, policies and progress to date on reducing emissions in its own operations, its value chain, and its business with clients. The Transition Plan also includes net zero targets in three additional carbon-intensive sectors in the bank\u2019s corporate loan portfolio, in line with Deutsche Bank\u2019s commitments as a member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance.\nOn October 10, 2023, Deutsche Bank announced the formation of a new Nature Advisory Panel, which aims to help the bank assess nature-related risks and identify new financial product offerings tied to the challenge of reversing biodiversity loss. The Panel brings together senior Deutsche Bank executives with experts from external organisations including the United Nations, World Wide Fund for Nature and The Nature Conservancy. \nGroup results at a glance\n\u00b9For a description of this and other non-GAAP financial measures, see \u2018Use of non-GAAP financial measures\u2019 on pp 15-20 of the third quarter 2023 Financial Data Supplement and \u201cNon-GAAP financial measures\u201d on pp. 56-61 of the third quarter 2023 Earnings Report, respectively.\n\u00b2Cumulative ESG volumes include sustainable financing (flow) and investments (stock) in the Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Private Bank from January 1, 2020 to date, as set forth in Deutsche Bank\u2019s Sustainability Deep Dive of May 20, 2021.
