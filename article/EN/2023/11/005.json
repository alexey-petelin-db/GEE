    "title": "S&P upgrades Deutsche Bank\u2019s credit ratings",
    "body": "S&P Global Ratings, the leading rating agency, today upgraded Deutsche Bank\u2019s (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) credit ratings \u2013 the third successive upgrade of Deutsche Bank\u2019s credit ratings by a leading rating agency during 2023.\nS&P raises its long- and short-term credit ratings on Deutsche Bank AG to 'A/A-1' from 'A-/A-2', outlook stable, and its long-term resolution counterparty rating to 'A+' from 'A'. S&P\u2019s long-term issue ratings on senior preferred, senior nonpreferred, Tier 2, and additional Tier 1 debt are all upgraded by one notch.\nExplaining the rationale for this move, S&P highlighted Deutsche Bank\u2019s progress in \u201cgrowing its franchise, strengthening its earnings, and maintaining solid capital and liquidity profiles,\u201d adding: \u201cThe stable outlook reflects our expectation that the bank will maintain its disciplined strategic execution and improve its performance toward its 2025 targets.\u201d\n\u201cWe are delighted to see further recognition for Deutsche Bank\u2019s strength and progress from a key stakeholder,\u201d said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThis upgrade reflects the hard work of our people to transform Deutsche Bank into a focused, profitable and resilient Global Hausbank. We are determined to build on this progress by growing our franchise, supporting clients through uncertain times, and boosting returns to shareholders.\u201d\nJames von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, added: \u201cDeutsche Bank has built key strengths: a focused and well-balanced business model delivering earnings and franchise growth, a high-quality loan portfolio, capital strength and a solid liquidity and funding base. It is very encouraging to see our strength and resilience recognised, once again, by S&P.\u201d\nS&P upgrades Deutsche Bank: key success factors\nReaping the benefits of successful transformation: S&P comments: \u201cThe rating action reflects Deutsche Bank's strengthened performance and resilience. The 2019-2022 transformation program established a more focused and profitable bank, and management is now focused on delivering franchise growth and operating leverage.\u201d S&P adds: \u201cWe also see structural improvements, including more disciplined strategic execution and a stronger focus on cost efficiency.\u201d\nA high-quality loan portfolio: S&P notes: \u201cDeutsche Bank's lending is diversified by sector and well-collateralized, and has performed solidly despite tepid economic growth, particularly in its home market of Germany.\u201d The agency adds that, even in a hypothetical stress scenario, an impact on the loan book would be unlikely to impact the bank\u2019s capital base.\nSolid liquidity and funding: in S&P\u2019s view, Deutsche Bank\u2019s \u201c132% liquidity coverage ratio and 121% net stable funding ratio as of Sept. 30, 2023, were consistent with internal targets.\u201d S&P adds: \u201cWe view positively that 71% of the deposit base came from the bank's home market and, excluding bank deposits, 39% of the deposit base was insured.\u201d\nResilience in the face of market turbulence: S&P also notes that Deutsche Bank demonstrated strong balance sheet management in the face of market turbulence earlier in 2023: \u201cDeutsche Bank's liquidity position was tested in March 2023 following short-selling of its shares and it navigated this short-lived stress well, in our view.\u201d\nA strong capital base provides scope for expanded and accelerated distributions to shareholders: S&P comments: \u201cWe think Deutsche Bank has supportive capitalization. Its regulatory metrics and guidance surprised on the upside in the third quarter of 2023.\u201d Furthermore, the agency notes: \u201cThe common equity Tier 1 ratio improved to 13.9% and management indicated that it will potentially free up about \u20ac3 billion more capital than it previously planned. As a result, it looks likely to raise its \u20ac8 billion target for shareholder distributions in 2021-2025.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s ratings with leading agencies, including today\u2019s upgrades, are as follows:",
