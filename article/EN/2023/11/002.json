    "body": "Deutsche Bank AG (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) has been informed by the European Central Bank (ECB) of its decision on prudential capital requirements with effect from January 1, 2024. These requirements follow the 2023 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).\nFrom this date, Deutsche Bank will be required to hold a Pillar 2 requirement (P2R) of 2.65%, a reduction of five basis points compared to the bank\u2019s current P2R. The ECB has also set a P2R-L for the leverage ratio for the first time; effective January 1, 2024, this requirement will be 10 basis points.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s 2024 requirements are as follows:\nThese requirements set the levels below which Deutsche Bank would be required to calculate a Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA). The MDA is used to determine restrictions on distributions, notably dividends on common shares, new variable remuneration and coupon payments to holders of Additional Tier 1 instruments.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s last reported consolidated capital ratios, as of 30 September 2023, were significantly above the supervisory requirements. The reduced P2R for solvency ratios in 2024 further increases these buffers.",
