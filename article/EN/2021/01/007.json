This is a great opportunity to create new solutions for the complex issues pertaining to payments\u201d, says Peter Bakenecker, Divisional President Germany and Switzerland at  Mastercard. \u201cWe have been collaborating for many years already and want to deepen our joint endeavours. The timing is ideal given current market developments, the imminent pandemic-induced shifts in global payments and companies\u2019 accelerated digital transformation.\u201d\nPayments is a high growth segment \nWith the coronavirus pandemic acting as a catalyst, payments is currently one of the fastest growing businesses in the banking industry, with revenues projected to grow by six percent per year until 2023 (source: McKinsey) and the number of transactions forecast to rise by 11 percent per year over the same period (source: Capgemini).\nAs one of the world\u2019s leading banks in euro payments clearing and one of the main clearers of US dollar payments outside the US, Deutsche Bank is already among the biggest payment clearers worldwide.",
