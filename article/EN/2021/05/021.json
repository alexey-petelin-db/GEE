    "title": "Innovation in advisory: how ESG is shaping corporate M&A",
    "body": "ESG has been the fastest growing segment in capital markets over the past two years, with the shift in capital allocation being abundantly evident. This raises the question of how the trend translates to a change in capital allocation of corporates and, in particular, how it impacts their M&A strategy. In this podcast we discuss the implications of ESG on strategic decisions at board level, how our corporate clients are incorporating ESG into the traditional M&A process, and how we as a bank can help our clients in managing this transition. Listen to:\nBerthold Fuerst, Co-Head of Investment Banking Coverage & Advisory, EMEA\nKhaled Fathallah, Head of Origination & Advisory ESG; EMEA Head of Natural Resources\nHenrik Bjerregaard, Director in EMEA M&A\n\nfrom left to right: Berthold Fuerst, Khaled Fathallah, Henrik Bjerregaard\nListen to the podcast",
