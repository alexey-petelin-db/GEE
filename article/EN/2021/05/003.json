    "body": "Deutsche Bank acted as a top-tier lender and Bookrunner on a new, sustainability-linked, multi-currency \u20ac2.5 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) for Iberdrola.\nThe facility is linked to two sustainability indicators: the reduction of emissions by the company and a greater presence of women in leadership positions.\nUnique features of the deal\nThis is the first transaction by a Spanish company to reference risk free rates (RFRs) instead of LIBOR, serving as a model for future financing.\nIberdrola and the supporting banks also introduced, for the first time, a third social factor. Each year, a financial contribution will be made by Iberdrola to a sustainable project, for an amount depending on the degree of utilisation of the credit line. The beneficiary project will be defined by 2022 and the first contribution will be made in 2023.\nThis deal contributes towards Deutsche Bank\u2019s target of delivering at least \u20ac200 billion in sustainable finance by 2025.\nIberdrola is a global energy leader, the number one producer of wind power, and one of the world's biggest electricity utilities in terms of market capitalisation.",
