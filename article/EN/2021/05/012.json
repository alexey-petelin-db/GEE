    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE/ NYSE: DB) announced the completion of the tender offers to repurchase up to 1 billion of two senior non-preferred zero coupon securities, issued in 1996/1997 (DE0001342244/ DE0001892057) and re-denominated in Euro in 1999. Deutsche Bank launched the tender offers on 14 June 2021.\nThe two tender offers resulted in a repurchase of bonds with a notional value of 313 million euros.\nThe relatively low investor participation in this public tender offer reflects Deutsche Bank\u2019s improved credit profile and an investor preference to retain exposure to Deutsche Bank.\nIn 2021 to date, DB has completed 9 benchmark issuances and raised 11 billion euros amid strong investor demand.\nFurther details can be found on Deutsche Bank\u2019s Investor Relations website under https://www.db.com/ir.",
