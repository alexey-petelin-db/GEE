    "title": "Fitch upgrades Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings and maintains a positive outlook",
    "body": "Fitch Ratings today announced upgrades to Deutsche Bank\u2019s ratings. The agency has raised our Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to BBB+ from BBB, and our Viability Rating (VR) to bbb+ from bbb. Our Derivative Counterparty Rating, long-term deposit rating and senior preferred debt ratings are all raised to A- from BBB+. In addition, the agency retains its Positive Outlook on these higher ratings. The bank is now on \u2018Outlook Positive\u2019 with all three leading rating agencies.\nThis is Fitch\u2019s first upgrade of Deutsche Bank\u2019s benchmark IDR since the agency initiated coverage in 1988, and the first upgrade of the VR, then referred to as the Individual Rating, since 2005. It follows a similar move by Moody\u2019s, who raised the bank\u2019s ratings and maintained a Positive Outlook on August 4.\nSumming up the rationale for this move, Fitch pointed to successful execution of Deutsche Bank\u2019s transformation programme: \u201cThe upgrades reflect good progress and increasingly manageable challenges arising from the restructuring initiated in 2019, which we expect to remain well on track in the second half of 2021 and 2022.\u201d\n\u201cThis marks another milestone on our path of transformation\u201d, said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThis is well-deserved recognition for the efforts of our people, who are delivering a historic transformation of Deutsche Bank in challenging conditions. The right business model, a strong client franchise, conservative balance sheet management and a strong risk profile have all contributed to this result. We appreciate Fitch\u2019s confidence that we will now complete our transformation successfully.\u201d\nJames von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, added: \u201cWe are very pleased that, for the second time in two months, we see a leading rating agency recognising our progress in this way. This move supports our business with clients and enables us to continue to fund our activities on favourable terms. By maintaining a Positive Outlook in addition to these upgrades, Fitch encourages us to keep up the pace of disciplined execution and complete the transformation journey.\u201d",
