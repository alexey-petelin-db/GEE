All our businesses have contributed to the year-on-year profit growth, gained further relevance for our clients and continued to capture market share. Once again, our cost and risk management provided us with firm foundations. Our priority now is to continue with our disciplined execution of transformation, quarter by quarter.\nChristian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer\nDeutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today reported its best second quarter and best first half year since 2015. Significant year on year profit improvement across all businesses was driven by resilient revenues, sustained progress on cost reduction and substantial year on year improvements in provision for credit losses.\nAcross the board profit improvement\nGroup profit before tax was \u20ac 1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021, versus \u20ac 158 million in the second quarter of 2020. Net profit was \u20ac 828 million, up from \u20ac 61 million in the prior year quarter. Post-tax return on average shareholders\u2019 equity was 4.9% and post-tax RoTE1 was 5.5% in the quarter. The cost/income ratio was 80%, down from 85% in the prior year quarter.\nThe quarter reflected a negative impact on profit before tax of \u20ac 226 million from the ruling by the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof or \u2018BGH\u2019) in April 2021 requiring active customer consent for pricing changes on current accounts (for more information on this ruling, please see the \u2018Provisions\u2019 section of the Interim Report).\nThis included an impact of \u20ac 96 million in foregone revenues, of which \u20ac 93 million was in the Private Bank Germany with the balance in the International Private Bank and Corporate Bank. The cost impact was \u20ac 130 million in litigation expenses, also predominantly in the Private Bank.\nFor the first six months of 2021, profit before tax was \u20ac 2.8 billion, up from \u20ac 364 million in the same period of 2020. Net profit was \u20ac 1.9 billion, up from \u20ac 126 million in the prior year period. Post-tax RoTE1 was 6.5%, and 7.6% if adjusted for transformation-related effects1 and specific revenue items. The cost/income ratio was 78%, down from 87% in the first six months of 2020.\nIn the Core Bank, which excludes the Capital Release Unit, second-quarter profit before tax rose 90% to \u20ac 1.4 billion. All four core businesses contributed to this year on year improvement in profitability. Post-tax RoTE1 was 7.8%, up from 3.4% in the prior year quarter, while the cost/income ratio was 76%. Adjusted profit before tax, which excludes specific revenue items, transformation charges, impairments of goodwill and intangibles and restructuring and severance, rose 72% to \u20ac 1.6 billion.\nFor the first six months, Core Bank profit before tax near-doubled to \u20ac 3.4 billion. Post-tax RoTE1 was 9.3%, in line with the Core Bank\u2019s full-year 2022 target, and 10.5% if adjusted for transformation-related effects1 and specific revenue items. The cost/income ratio was 73%, down from 77% in the prior year period.\nCapital Release Unit: significant loss reduction\nThe Capital Release Unit reported a loss before tax of \u20ac 258 million in the quarter, down by 56% from a loss of \u20ac 591 million in the second quarter of 2020. The adjusted loss before tax was \u20ac 236 million, down 54% year on year. This improvement was driven primarily by cost reduction: noninterest expenses were down 48% year on year to \u20ac 259 million, while adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 were down 45% to \u20ac 236 million. Net revenues were negative \u20ac24 million, an improvement versus negative \u20ac 66 million in the prior year quarter.\nThe Capital Release Unit further reduced RWAs and leverage exposure. RWAs were reduced from \u20ac 34 billion to \u20ac 32 billion during the quarter, in line with the Unit\u2019s end-2022 target, and a reduction of 24% over the past twelve months. The Unit reduced leverage exposure by \u20ac 10 billion to \u20ac 71 billion during the quarter, and by 30% versus the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nFor the first six months, the Capital Release Unit reported a loss before tax of \u20ac 668 million, a reduction of more than half versus the \u20ac 1.4 billion loss before tax in the first six months of 2020. This improvement was driven largely by a 36% year on year reduction in noninterest expenses to \u20ac 757 million, while adjusted costs ex-transformation charges were reduced by 40% to \u20ac 658 million. Net revenues were \u20ac 57 million for the first six months, an improvement of \u20ac 180 million versus the first six months of 2020.\nRevenues: resilience despite market normalisation and specific effects\nGroup net revenues were \u20ac 6.2 billion, down 1% versus the second quarter of 2020. Revenue development in the quarter reflected the normalisation of financial markets compared to the prior year quarter, continued low interest rates, and the impact of foregone revenues due to the BGH ruling. Revenues in the Core Bank were \u20ac 6.3 billion, down 1%. \nFor the first six months, Group net revenues grew 7% to \u20ac 13.5 billion, while Core Bank net revenues grew 5% to \u20ac 13.4 billion.\nSecond quarter revenue development in Deutsche Bank\u2019s core businesses was as follows:\nCorporate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 1.2 billion, down 8% year on year, or down 6% if adjusted for currency translation effects. Net revenues were essentially unchanged versus the prior year quarter if adjusted for episodic items, including recoveries related to credit protection and portfolio rebalancing actions, which were substantially lower than in the second quarter of 2020. Interest rate headwinds were offset by the positive effects of business growth and further progress on deposit re-pricing, which covered accounts with deposits of \u20ac 87 billion, up from \u20ac 83 billion at the end of the previous quarter and contributing \u20ac 85 million in quarterly net revenues. Deutsche Bank also recaptured the No. 1 position for German Corporate Banking in FINANCE-Magazin\u2019s annual survey. For the first six months, net revenues were \u20ac 2.5 billion, down 5% year on year, reflecting the aforementioned factors impacting the second quarter.\nInvestment Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.4 billion, down 11%. Revenues in Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) were \u20ac 1.8 billion, down 11%. This development largely reflected the anticipated normalisation of financial market activity compared to the second quarter of 2020, which impacted revenues in Rates, Emerging Markets and FX. This was partly offset by strong year on year growth in Credit, both Trading and Financing. Origination & Advisory revenues were 2% higher at \u20ac 624 million. Advisory revenues were more than double the prior year quarter, driven by higher M&A activity, while lower levels of Investment Grade Debt issuance in normalising markets more than offset growth and market share gains (source: Dealogic) in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. Deutsche Bank returned to the No. 1 position in Origination & Advisory in Germany in the quarter (source: Dealogic). For the first six months, Investment Bank net revenues were up 9% to \u20ac 5.5 billion.\nPrivate Bank net revenues were \u20ac 2.0 billion, up 3% versus the prior year quarter, and up 8% if adjusted for the impact of the BGH ruling. Continued business growth in improved market conditions more than offset pressure on deposit margins from low interest rates. New business volumes of \u20ac 14 billion in the quarter included \u20ac 4 billion in net new client loans and \u20ac 7 billion in net inflows of investment products, the sixth consecutive quarter of net inflows into investment products. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany were down 1%, and up 7% if adjusted for the \u20ac 93 million impact of the BGH ruling. Revenues in the International Private Bank grew by 9%, or 8% excluding specific items. For the first six months, Private Bank net revenues rose to \u20ac 4.2 billion, up 2% year on year or up 4% if adjusted for the \u20ac 94 million impact of the BGH ruling. This increase was supported by continued new business growth, with net new business volumes of \u20ac 29 billion in the first half of 2021 including net new client loans of \u20ac 9 billion and net inflows in investment products of \u20ac 16 billion.    \nAsset Management net revenues were \u20ac 626 million in the quarter, up 14%. Growth was driven primarily by 15% growth in management fees, as five consecutive quarters of client inflows and supportive market performance more than offset continued industry-wide margin pressure. Net inflows were a record \u20ac 20 billion in the quarter, driven by positive flows across asset classes in all regions, and including \u20ac 3.8 billion in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) assets. These record inflows and strong investment performance contributed to \u20ac 39 billion growth in Assets under Management to \u20ac 859 billion in the quarter, a new record level, and \u20ac 114 billion or 15% higher than at the end of the prior year quarter. For the first six months, net revenues grew 18% to \u20ac 1.3 billion, total net inflows were \u20ac 21 billion, and Assets under Management grew by \u20ac 67 billion.\nFurther cost reduction\nNoninterest expenses were reduced by 7% to \u20ac 5.0 billion in the quarter, despite pressure from several external factors including the aforementioned \u20ac 130 million in litigation provisions relating to the BGH ruling. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges were reduced by 6% year on year to \u20ac 4.6 billion.\nThe workforce was reduced by an additional 592 full-time equivalents (FTEs) to 83,797 during the quarter, and by approximately 3,000 FTEs over the past twelve months. At the end of the quarter, Deutsche Bank had recognised 90% of the total transformation-related effects1 anticipated through the end of 2022.\nFor the first six months, noninterest expenses were down 4% to \u20ac 10.6 billion. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 and reimbursable expenses related to Prime Finance were down 4% to \u20ac 9.8 billion, including \u20ac 547 million in bank levies.\nSustained year on year improvement in provision for credit losses\nProvision for credit losses was \u20ac 75 million in the quarter, equivalent to 7 basis points of average loans on an annualised basis, and down by 90% compared to \u20ac 761 million in the second quarter of 2020. Provisions for non-performing loans (Stage 3) were \u20ac 111 million in the quarter, down 33% on the previous quarter and down by 78% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Stage 3 provisions were offset by releases of \u20ac 36 million in provisions for performing loans (Stage 1 and 2) which reflected a positive macro-economic outlook.\nFor the first six months, provision for credit losses was \u20ac 144 million, or 7 basis points of average loans annualised, down from \u20ac 1.3 billion, or 57 basis points of average loans annualised, in the prior year period. \nConservative capital and balance sheet management\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.2% in the quarter, a decline of 55 basis points compared to 13.7% in the previous quarter. This development reflects a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points from the regulatory-driven increases in RWAs relating to the ECB\u2019s Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) amendments taking effect in the quarter as expected.\nThe TRIM decisions reflected in the second quarter conclude the multi-year TRIM programme for Deutsche Bank. These factors were partly counterbalanced by a positive impact of 12 basis points from organic capital generation through net income, after deductions for dividends, of \u20ac 274 million, and for coupons for Additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments in the quarter. As at June 30, Deutsche Bank had deducted \u20ac 575 million for dividends from first-half 2021 earnings.\nRisk Weighted Assets (RWAs) rose from \u20ac 330 billion to \u20ac 345 billion during the second quarter. This development was almost entirely due to the impact of the aforementioned TRIM decisions and CRR amendments. \nThe Leverage Ratio (fully-loaded) rose to 4.8% in the second quarter, up from 4.6% in the previous quarter. On a phase-in basis, the Leverage Ratio rose to 4.9%, from 4.7% in the previous quarter. These ratios exclude certain central bank balances under applicable rules. Including these balances, the fully-loaded Leverage Ratio would have been 4.3% in the quarter.\nLiquidity Reserves rose \u20ac 11 billion to \u20ac 254 billion during the quarter, including High Quality Liquid Assets of \u20ac 224 billion, up by \u20ac 4 billion during the quarter. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 143%, a surplus over regulatory requirements of \u20ac 67 billion.\n2022 ratio targets reaffirmed; guidance updated\nDeutsche Bank reaffirmed its 2022 ratio targets in the light of progress made in its transformation, namely: a post-tax RoTE1 of 8% at Group level and over 9% for the Core Bank; a cost/income ratio of 70%; a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 12.5% and a leverage ratio (fully-loaded) of approximately 4.5%. With Deutsche Bank\u2019s transformation significantly advanced and having evidenced sustainable profitability in the first half of 2021, management is updating cost guidance to focus on the cost/income ratio.\nThis more accurately reflects the sustainable margin which the bank is targeting.  Accordingly, the bank will no longer disclose an absolute cost target, previously \u20ac 16.7 billion, for 2022.\nDeutsche Bank also provided updated guidance on the drivers of these target ratios as transformation advances. Management expects net revenues to be ahead of guidance provided at the Investor Deep Dive on December 9, 2020. The bank sees a substantial portion of its revenue growth in recent quarters as sustainable, as underpinned by strong business growth in 2021 to date and the expected gradual easing of interest rate headwinds in future quarters. Additionally, provision for credit losses is expected to be lower than previous guidance, in a range of around 20 basis points of average loans. \nThe bank expects these positive factors to counterbalance additional expenses due to unforeseen factors arising in 2021, including higher-than-expected contributions to the Single Resolution Fund and the German statutory deposit guarantee scheme. Management believes these items will exceed its initial plan by approximately \u20ac 400 million in total. The bank also foresees additional expenses arising from higher business volumes and investments in the control environment.\nIn line with its firm commitment to continued discipline on controllable cost items, management has initiated a series of incremental cost reduction measures to mitigate these additional cost pressures. For more information on the bank\u2019s financial and regulatory targets, please see the \u2018Strategy\u2019 section of the Interim Report.\nSustainable finance: record quarterly volume underpins outperformance\nDeutsche Bank remains ahead of target in pursuit of its goal, of at least \u20ac 200 billion in cumulative Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)-related financing and investments excluding DWS from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2023. At the end of the second quarter, cumulative ESG financing and investments reached \u20ac 99 billion, close to the bank\u2019s full-year interim goal of at least \u20ac 100 billion by end-2021.\nIn the second quarter, ESG financing and investment volumes were a record \u20ac 27 billion. Deutsche Bank\u2019s businesses contributed to this total as follows:\nThe Corporate Bank added \u20ac 6 billion in sustainable financing, bringing its cumulative total to \u20ac 15 billion;\nIn the Investment Bank, sustainable financing and capital market issuance volumes were \u20ac 15 billion in the quarter, bringing the division\u2019s cumulative total to \u20ac 56 billion;\nThe Private Bank added \u20ac 7 billion to reach a cumulative total of \u20ac 28 billion. During the quarter, investment volumes were \u20ac 6 billion, with an additional \u20ac 1 billion in new client loans. Cumulative total volumes now stand at \u20ac 19 billion for the Private Bank Germany and \u20ac 9 billion for the International Private Bank.\nDuring the quarter, Deutsche Bank joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance, committing to align its operational and attributable emissions from its loan portfolio with pathways to net zero by 2050. This supplements the bank\u2019s signing of the Collective Commitment to Climate Action of the German financial sector and Deutsche Bank\u2019s commitment to publish the carbon footprint of its \u20ac 445 billion loan portfolio by the end of 2022. The bank continued to refine its Climate Risk methodology and data strategy in alignment with other financial institutions and collaborative cross-industry bodies.\nIn May 2021, Deutsche Bank became the first bank to join the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA) as a full member and announced its support for the Monetary Authority of Singapore in establishing an ESG Center of Excellence which will focus on public and private ESG transactions, product development and advisory services. Asset Management was selected to advise and help drive the global Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI) and will form part of NZAMI\u2019s newly formed advisory group.\nRead \nPDF\nthe full media release in the downloadable PDF.",
