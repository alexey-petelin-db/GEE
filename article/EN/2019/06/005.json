Thanks to her many years of international experience in a variety of areas in the financial industry, including at Barclays Bank Plc, a major bank with global operations, she brings key expertise to the Supervisory Board.\u201d\nFor 24 years, Dagmar Valc\u00e1rcel has held various positions in the financial industry, in Germany, the UK, Spain, Greece, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Until June 2019, she was the Non-Executive Chair of the Management Board of Andbank Asset Management Luxembourg, and she has been a member of the Supervisory Board of amedes Holding, based in Hamburg, since 2015. Previously, from 2010 until 2017, she held various leading roles in Barclays Bank, among others, as General Counsel for Western Europe and Head of Strategic Resolution for Insurance Operations.
