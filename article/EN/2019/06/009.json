She joined from Banque de France in 2014. During her time at Deutsche Bank, she has significantly increased the scope and the quality of compliance and anti-financial crime controls. \u201cUnder Sylvie Matherat\u2019s leadership the bank has significantly invested in technology and personnel and strengthened its control systems.

He was also responsible for developing the bank\u2019s Asian operations in Mumbai and Beijing. Having headed Private & Business Clients Germany since 2006, he joined the Management Board of Postbank in 2011 and became Chairman one year later. \u201dFor almost 30 years Frank Strau\u00df has shown strong leadership and made an important contribution to successfully developing the Private and Corporate Banking of Deutsche Bank.
