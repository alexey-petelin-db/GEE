This is the first time Deutsche Bank has ranked No. 1 across both regions, and it is also the first bank to ever achieve this feat. Last year Deutsche Bank Research had 16 analyst awards across the two surveys.\nJoe Liew, Head of Equity Research, APAC, said: \u201cRanking first across Asia, Hong Kong and China is an amazing achievement and I am very proud of our accomplishment. It is testament to the calibre of analysts we have in the equity research department across the region, who work tirelessly to analyse latest developments in their stocks and sectors.\n\u201cI am excited and optimistic about 2019 given the quadrupling of weight given to China A shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. With a dedicated and experienced research team, we are well placed to continue providing differentiated, thought leading research to our clients.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank Research ranked No.1 in the following categories:\nAsia\nTop Earnings Estimators: Consumer Goods and Services, Real Estate Management & Development, Telecommunications\nTop Stock Pickers: Metals & Mining, Interactive Media & Services\nHong Kong and China\nTop Earnings Estimator: Overall Telecommunications Services, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate, Telecommunications Services\nTop Stock Pickers: Retailing\nFor the past 15 years, StarMine has identified the leading global analysts in two main categories: stock recommendation performance relative to specific industry benchmarks (Stock Pickers) and accuracy in forecasting earnings as compared with peers (Earnings Estimators).\nRefinitiv Analyst Awards are globally recognised as the gold standard in objective measurement of sell-side analyst performance.
