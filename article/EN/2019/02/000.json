    "body": "In this Asia Takeaway, APAC Co-Head of CIB\u2019s Institutional Client Group (ICG) David Beale, tells us why China\u2019s inclusion in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index is such a significant market milestone.\nWith 2.5 trillion US dollars in international assets tracking the index, China\u2019s inclusion is a major step to increasing global investor access to China fixed income.\n\u201cChina will gradually reach just over 6% of the index and will be the fourth largest currency component behind the US dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen,\u201d he said.\nChina\u2019s 12 trillion US dollars domestic bond market joins the index on April 1. \u201cThis represents the single largest rebalancing in this index\u2019s history,\u201d added Beale.",
