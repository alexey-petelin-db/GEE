    "body": "\u201cThere are numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements in The New York Times story. We stand by the statements made to Senator Van Hollen in 2017: We have taken steps to ensure the bank\u2019s policies, processes and controls address the potential for conflicts of interest. We are safeguarding the integrity of the decision-making process with respect to clients that hold public office or perform public functions in the U.S. As we further pointed out at the time, state and federal law require that the bank maintain the privacy of its customers and the confidentiality of information relating to those customers. Legal restrictions on the bank prevent us from refuting publicly, and in detail, the inaccuracies in The New York Times story.\u201d",
