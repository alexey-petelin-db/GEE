    "body": "The Association of South-East Nations (ASEAN) continues to establish itself as low-cost manufacturing hub for the rest of the world, attracting investment from foreign businesses and strengthening two-way trade and investment flow between Asia and the EU.

In 2017, Vietnam recorded the largest advance of 19 percent followed by the Philippines at 18 percent (according to WTO).\nASEAN\u2019s payment landscape is leapfrogging from being one of the worlds\u2019 most cash and paper-based to the most advanced, with instant payments based on an e-payment system called \u2018any ID\u2019 already being rolled out in four markets.\nASEAN has an estimated 330 million internet users.\nWant to know more about how digitalisation is supporting ASEAN trade?
