Deutsche Bank is proud to support initiatives that are having a positive impact on girls\u2019 and women\u2019s lives around the world. We\u2019ll be introducing you to just some of them in the run up to International Women\u2019s Day.\nDaxa ben Bharvada was a second generation \u2018rag picker\u2019 in Ahmedabad, India. At age 10, she joined her mother in wading through mountains of waste and muck at dumps in search of materials they could resell.\nAfter 16 years, Daxa was earning less than two euros a month to help support her family.\n\u201cWaste collectors are the poorest of the poor,\u201d said Reema Nanavaty, Director at the Self Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA). \u201cThey spend 18 hours a day at the dump searching for waste to sell to earn a living. The conditions are worse than most of us can imagine.\u201d\nSEWA is an organisation of poor, self-employed women who help themselves and other disadvantaged women achieve their goals of self-reliance through self-employment.\nLast year Deutsche Bank\u2019s Made for Good programme \u2013 which supports businesses that drive positive societal change \u2013 provided funding for a recycling facility run by a training cooperative called \u2018Gitanjali\u2019. This facility provides training for 200 women on how to make stationery from recycled waste materials, run a small, independent stationery business and manage their finances, while the cooperative employs 60 local women who are also its shareholders.\n\u201cStories like Daxa\u2019s are common across India,\u201d said Ruchi Khemka, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility, India. \u201cOur Made for Good programme focuses on building up women because when you empower women, you effect positive change in whole communities. By helping women achieve financial stability and independence and teaching them entrepreneurship, we\u2019re helping to break the cycle of poverty.\u201d\nLast year, Daxa took part in the training at the recycling facility. Now she no longer spends her days picking through the waste for less than two euros a month; instead, she runs her own business selling stationery and earns 65 euros a month \u2013 a sum that might seem small for many but which has allowed Daxa to leave the dump, support her family and become completely self-sufficient.\n\nFor further information visit Made for Good",
