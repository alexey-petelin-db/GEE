    "body": "\u201cNo more trees should fall than can regrow,\u201d Hans Carl von Carlowitz, a German mining administrator and the first person to clearly formulate the concept of sustainability in forestry, wrote in 1713.\nThe idea of sustainable living in harmony with nature dates back centuries and arguably to prehistoric times, according to a brief history of Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) investing by Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Investment Office entitled \u201c\nPDF\nESG yesterday, today, tomorrow\u201d.\nAfter generations of ecological damage, the growing field of ESG investing offers hope of a more sustainable era that could achieve not just ecological balance but also economic security and social justice.\n\u201cThe agrarian and industrial revolutions created huge benefits for humanity but also the present threat of environmental collapse,\u201d according to author Markus M\u00fcller, Global Head of the WM CIO. However, \u201cwith ESG investing, the power of finance can be channelled to support the broader objectives of society.\u201d\nSustainability must be built into the \u201csystem\u201d and not imposed retrospectively, M\u00fcller argues. That includes the careful use of resources, environmentally friendly production processes, an integrated economic order for the preservation of our natural habitat and an inclusive understanding of growth and society.\nDeutsche Bank Wealth Management is significantly accelerating its ESG strategy as a new generation of wealthy clients increasingly ask their advisers to help them add purpose to investment performance. Its new approach includes adopting ESG ratings from MSCI, a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community, to give clients valuable standardised information on non-financial risks and opportunities when making investment decisions.",
