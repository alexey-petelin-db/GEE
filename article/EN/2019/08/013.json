    "body": "\"We at Deutsche Bank very much welcome that climate protection is now right at the top of the social and political agenda. We support all the efforts to enable Germany to achieve its climate goals for 2030.\nThis requires more research into low-carbon technologies and a binding, long-term framework for an effective and efficient climate policy. The climate goals can only be achieved if CO2 emissions are priced appropriately.\nA variety of instruments can be used \u2013 the decisive element is that the climate goals are achieved thanks to the right price signals and that economic welfare losses are kept to an absolute minimum.\nHowever, effective climate protection also requires international, and where possible global, initiatives. As a bank operating globally we regard it as one of our most important tasks to support companies worldwide as they transform into enterprises with a smaller carbon footprint.\"",
