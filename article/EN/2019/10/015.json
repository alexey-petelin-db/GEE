    "body": "Global debt levels are rising and investors need to be prepared to reassess their portfolios to prosper in a sustained low-yield environment, according to the latest Deutsche Bank Wealth Management Chief Investment Office (CIO) Insights Special \u2013 Peak Debt.\nInvestors should reconsider risk and investment time horizons amid fears about the direction and side-effects of current monetary policy, Chief Investment Officer Christian Nolting wrote in the report, which looks at historical debt trends, the policy implications of rising debt and possible investment responses.\nRather than waiting for higher or positive returns in high grade bonds, investors should instead see their merits as diversifiers \u2013 and look for yield elsewhere, he suggested.
