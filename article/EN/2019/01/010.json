    "body": "Deutsche Bank is delighted to extend its longstanding support of Frieze in London and New York to the first ever Frieze Los Angeles, presenting works by leading contemporary artists Victoria Fu and Tom Pope at the Paramount Studios in Hollywood.\n\u201cOur support for the launch of Frieze Los Angeles underlines our strong commitment to the US, and to the West Coast in particular as an increasingly important center for contemporary art, for business and for our clients,\u201d said Fabrizio Campelli, Global Head of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management.\nFrieze Los Angeles(LA), starting on February 14, is the latest edition of Frieze, which Deutsche Bank has sponsored as Global Lead Partner for more than 15 years.\nWhether showcasing the Deutsche Bank Collection, the most substantial corporate collection of contemporary works on paper and photography, partnering with international museums or sponsoring legendary performers in music or sporting events, promoting excellence across disciplines has a global positive impact.\nThorsten Strauss, Global Head of Art, Culture & Sports at Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cSupport of Frieze LA underscores our 40 year commitment to encouraging new and noteworthy talents in art, culture and sports from across the globe. We are delighted to present Victoria Fu and Tom Pope \u2013 two extraordinary artists \u2013 at the LA fair. Both art installations embrace the site in unique ways and reflect the international scope of both the Frieze platform and our own extensive program.\u201d\n  Victoria Fu Installation in the Deutsche Bank Wealth Management Lounge\nVictoria Fu, Still image from Te\u0301le\u0301voix 1, 2017\n  The Deutsche Bank Wealth Management Lounge at the Paramount Theater will display an installation by California-based artist Victoria Fu. In her multi-layered installations, Fu uses film, photography, sculpture and light to create unique, site-based viewing configurations that explore the virtual space of moving images and the relationship between touch and the digital world.\nResponding to the architecture of the Paramount Theater lobby, Fu will transform the environment with elements of light, both natural and artificial. Manipulating light projected onto the ceiling, filtering in from the windows and emitting from a neon sculpture, the artist creates an interplay between the above and below, abstraction and representation, the real and the virtual. Like an earlier generation of California artists experimenting with space and light, she references the luminous and the theatrical, two hallmarks of Hollywood and the Paramount Studios site.\n \nDeutsche Bank ArtSpace presents Tom Pope\u2019s One Square Club\nTom Pope, Pop(e), 2017 (l.) and One Square Club, 2018, (r.)\n  In the Paramount Pictures Studios\u2019 backlot, the Deutsche Bank ArtSpace at Frieze Los Angeles will present UK performance artist Tom Pope\u2019s One Square Club. What may be the smallest and most exclusive private members\u2019 club in the world is a unique space measuring just one square meter which offers premium facilities including a bar, music and games.\nMembers of the One Square Club are also participating in an experimental artwork. Pope is the flamboyant host of this interactive performance and fully functioning private members\u2019 club where the members actively shape how their time is spent and how the experience unfolds. The club, like a dormant stage, comes to life when the members and host engage collaboratively.\n  Press contacts:\nCarlotta Dennis-Lovaglio or Lucinda Riding or call +44 020 3487 0077.\nTo find out more about Deutsche Bank\u2019s support for art, culture and sports, please contact Klaus Winker or call +49 69 910 32249\nTo find out more about Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, please contact Christina Partyka on +1 212 250 1013 or Adrian Cox on +44 20 7541 7775.\n  About Deutsche Bank Wealth Management\nWith client assets of approximately 300 billion euros (as at September 30, 2018), Deutsche Bank\u2019s Wealth Management is one of the largest wealth managers worldwide.
