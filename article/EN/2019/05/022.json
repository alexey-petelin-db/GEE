To achieve this, we needed not only innovative technology but a strategic partner that could execute globally and understand our business needs. We are buoyed by what we\u2019ve achieved so far and look forward to continuing on this journey with Red Hat,\u201d said Tom Gilbert, Global Head of Cloud, Application, and Integration Platforms.\n\u201cHuge congratulations to everyone who contributed to this success.
