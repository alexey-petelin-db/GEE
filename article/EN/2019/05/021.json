    "body": "\u201cThis report does not reflect the current situation of our bank and its control environment. The vast majority of the legacy cases mentioned date back to the time prior to 2016. While we acknowledge that there is still work ahead of us, we have significantly improved our risk and control systems in the last three years and we will continue to do so.\nMoreover, the share price should not be seen as an indicator for financial stability. We have a very robust balance sheet with a high capital ratio, ample liquidity and a strong asset quality. In line with our 2018 targets the management board brought the bank back to profitability for the first time since 2014.\u201c",
