    "title": "John Cryan: \"We have to find a new role for ourselves in society\"",
    "body": "Restoring public trust in the financial sector is a key priority for the industry, and it begins with explaining how banks serve the real economy. \u201cWe have to find a new role for ourselves in society,\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Executive Officer John Cryan said at the 2017 IIF G20 Conference in Frankfurt on Wednesday. \u201cExplaining our purpose and role in society is important, and we are not doing a good job at the moment.\u201d\nCryan was on a panel that assessed the current state of banking in Europe alongside other CEOs of European banks. Comparing the banking industries in Europe and in the US, he noted that the entire US industry is smaller than the 20 largest European banks by assets. Still, US banks generated 170 billion US dollars of net income in 2016, while net income of the 20 largest European banks decreased to 33 billion euros. One of the main reasons for the higher profitability in the US is pricing, said Cryan. \"Clients in the US are prepared to pay more for banking services than European clients,\" he explained.\nHe highlighted the importance of more developed capital markets in Europe and of increased harmonisation across the region to enable cross-border banking. \u201cWe are still far away from a real banking union,\u201d Cryan said.\nAsked about the growing competition of Fintechs, Cryan said it is critical to \u201cwork with them, not against them\u201d. Pointing to the bank\u2019s Digital Factory, he noted that the cooperation can be very productive and that solutions offered by Fintechs make banking, including payment services, more user-friendly.\n  Taking stock of financial regulation\nEarlier in the day, Sylvie Matherat, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Regulatory Officer, spoke on a panel that took stock of financial regulation. \u201cIt is the right time for the public sector to assess the impact of regulation introduced since the financial crisis,\u201d she said. Meanwhile for banks, \u201cit is time to focus less on our balance sheet and more on our P&L.\u201d\nMatherat stated her belief that measures introduced to deal with systemic risk posed by large banks considered \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d help make the financial industry more resilient. However, they also tie up capital and liquidity and thus limit the ability of banks to provide financing to the real economy. \u201cIt is very good [for banks] to be able to die, but before you should be able to live,\u201d she said.\n  About the IIF G20 Conference\nThe ninth annual IIF G20 Conference, hosted by the Institute of International Finance, brought together more than 500 representatives from the private and public sector to facilitate dialogue on the key topics for the global economy. Deutsche Bank is a lead sponsor of the event.",
