    "title": "Deutsche Bank reaches settlement with the DFS over Russian securities trades",
    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) has reached a settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS). The settlement concludes the DFS\u2019s investigation into the bank\u2019s anti-money laundering control function in its investment banking division, including in relation to certain securities trades that occurred between 2011 and 2015 involving its Moscow, London and New York offices.\nUnder the terms of the settlement agreement with the DFS, Deutsche Bank entered into a Consent Order, and agreed to pay civil monetary penalties of 425 million dollars and to engage an independent monitor for a term of up to two years. The Consent Order acknowledged Deutsche Bank\u2019s cooperation and remediation efforts and noted that the DFS considered those efforts in arriving at the settlement amount.\nThe settlement amount is already materially reflected in existing litigation reserves. As previously disclosed, Deutsche Bank is cooperating with other regulators and law enforcement authorities, which have their own ongoing investigations into these securities trades.\nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides commercial and investment banking, retail banking, transaction banking and asset and wealth management products and services to corporations, governments, institutional investors, small and medium-sized businesses, and private individuals. Deutsche Bank is Germany\u2019s leading bank, with a strong position in Europe and a significant presence in the Americas and Asia Pacific.\nForward-looking statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they include statements about our beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them. These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to the management of Deutsche Bank. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could therefore cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nSuch factors include the conditions in the financial markets in Germany, in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues and in which we hold a substantial portion of our assets, the development of asset prices and market volatility, potential defaults of borrowers or trading counterparties, the implementation of our strategic initiatives, the reliability of our risk management policies, procedures and methods, and other risks referenced in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSuch factors are described in detail in our SEC Form 20-F of 11 March 2016 under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.
