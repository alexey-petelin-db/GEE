The Enabling Employers Awards is a nationally recognised award that acknowledges the efforts of employers in hiring and retaining employees with disabilities.\nThe bank won the award for its unique 10-week Work Placement Programme and for playing a leadership role in the formation of the Singapore Business Network on DisAbility Both programmes were led by dbEnable Singapore, the bank\u2019s disability focussed diversity pillar.\nThe Work Placement Programme was launched in 2014 for talented graduates with disabilities to encourage them to apply for roles at the bank. The programme helped more than 10 undergraduates to gain experience and explore a career in banking, where in the past they had often feared that they would not be considered due to their disability.\n\u201cIt is important that we reach out to a latent talent pool which is so easily overlooked,\u201d commented Bernd Starke, Head of Non-Bank Financial Institutions CBC Asia, Corporate & Investment Bank. and dbEnable lead for Singapore. \u201cTo create an inclusive bank that reflects society\u2019s diversity, we need to find ways to employ more people with disabilities,\u201d he added.\nDeutsche Bank took the lead in bringing together a community of businesses in Singapore under the banner of Singapore Business Network on DisAbility. \u201cThis opened up new opportunities for businesses to engage with a latent talent pool, as well as providing greater opportunity for people with disabilities to access employment that recognises their potential,\u201d explained Starke.\n\u201cDisability is an issue that has personal implications for all of us,\u201d said Philip Lee, Chief Country Officer for Singapore. \u201cWe want to find the best possible talent to make up the next generation of Deutsche Bank people \u2013 and that means recruiting according to talent and ability, without taking notice of matters which don\u2019t impact a candidate\u2019s ability to do their job.\u201d\nSingapore\u2019s Jaishankar Srinivasan and Bernd Starke receive Achievement Award for Innovation for a programme to enable people with disabilities into the workplace\n ",
