We have people from 150 different nationalities. You can expect a steep learning curve and an intellectual challenge. Be curious, agile, courageous; do your best and think positive.\u201d\nThe current group of trainees is equally diverse: 236 come from the United States, 123 from the Asia-Pacific region and 104 from Germany.
