    "title": "Deutsche Bank team raced for charity in New York City Marathon",
    "body": "A team of 12 Deutsche Bank employees from the Corporate & Investment Bank took to the streets of New York on Sunday, November 5 to run the New York City Marathon. The runners, who came from Frankfurt, London and New York, raised over 128,000 pounds for children\u2019s medical research charity Sparks.\nSparks will use the money to fund pioneering research into treatment for fetal membrane rupture, which causes 40 percent of premature births.\nThe team shared part of the 26.2 mile journey with 20-year old Briton Zoe North, who completed the route over 5 days. Zoe has cerebral palsy as a result of being born three months premature and often faces extreme difficulty with balance, muscle weakness and coordination.\nThis will be the second marathon that Zoe has completed with Deutsche Bank for Sparks after she walked the London Marathon last year.\nTake a look at the TeamZoe NY Marathon fundraising page.",
