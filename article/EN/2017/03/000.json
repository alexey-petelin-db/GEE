The dividend to be paid\nout of Deutsche Bank AG's distributable profit for 2016 contains a\ncomponent reflecting the distributable profit carried forward from 2015 of\napproximately EUR 165 million, and EUR 0.11 per share out of the\ndistributable profit for 2016. The aggregate amount of these proposed\ndividends is approximately EUR 400 million. Additionally, the Bank would\nexpect to recommend at least the payment of a minimum dividend of EUR 0.11\nper share for 2017.\nCurrent trading\nDeutsche Bank has made a positive start in the first two trading months of\n2017 (Footnote 3).\n* Global Markets has performed strongly against a weaker comparable period\nin 2016 with Debt Sales & Trading revenues up over 30% while Equities Sales\n& Trading was flat year on year.\n* Corporate Finance year to date performance was strong with revenues up\nover 15% year on year reflecting positive momentum in primary markets that\ndrove significant increases in debt and equity issuance.\n* Global Transaction Banking saw resilience in its client franchise, but\nsingle digit lower revenue performance in a macro environment that remains\nchallenging and from the consequences of intentional reductions in client\nperimeter during 2016.\n* In Private Wealth & Commercial Clients (PW&CC), revenues were flat versus\nthe comparable period in 2016 as the impact of low interest rates was\nmainly offset by positive developments in investment products supported by\nasset and deposit inflows.\n* In Postbank, operating performance was flat, but reported revenues were\nslightly down given the absence of one-off gains in the prior year and\nweaker hedging results.\n* Deutsche Asset Management had a modest improvement in revenues as well as\nthe reversal of negative asset flows seen in 2016.\nFootnotes:\n(1) Assumes capital raise of EUR 7.9 billion net of transaction costs and\nincluding associated impacts on reported 2016 CET1 capital of EUR 42.7\nbillion, RWA of EUR 358 billion and leverage exposure of EUR 1,348 billion.\nCapital accretion (through a combination of RWA reduction and capital\ncontribution) from Deutsche AM minority IPO and proposed disposals not\nincluded in pro-forma capital levels.\n(2) Adjusted Costs defined as total noninterest expense under IFRS,\nexcluding costs related to restructuring & severance, litigation,\nimpairment of goodwill and other intangibles.\n(3) Commentary on performance based on end-Feb 2017 financials compared to\nend-Feb 2016 financials and excluding material disposals in 2016 (Abbey\nLife, PCS, Hua Xia) and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA), Debt Valuation\nAdjustment (DVA), Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA).\nAn analyst event will take place tomorrow, March 6, at 14:00 GMT in London\nto detail these actions and updated targets.\n\nContact:\nMonika Schaller\nGlobal Head External Communications\nPhone: +49 69 910 48098\ne-mail: monika.schaller@db.com\n  _________________________________________________________________\nDeutsche Bank AG\nTaunusanlage 12\n60325 Frankfurt am Main\nGermany\nISIN: DE0005140008\nWKN: 514000\nListed: Regulated market in Berlin-Bremen, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt (Prime Standard), Hamburg, Hanover, Munich und Stuttgart; EUREX; NYSE\nThe International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) of further financial instruments issued by Deutsche Bank AG, and admitted to trading on a domestic organized market or for which such admission has been applied for, are available on Deutsche Bank\u2019s Investor Relations website under https://www.db.com/ir/ .\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nForward-looking statements contain risks\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
