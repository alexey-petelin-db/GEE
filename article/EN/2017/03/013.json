    "body": "Deutsche Bank AG (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) has successfully completed the capital increase from authorized capital against cash contributions it announced on 5 March 2017. The number of no par value shares of Deutsche Bank AG has increased by 687.5 million, from 1,379.3 million to 2,066.8 million through the public offering of new shares via subscription rights. The gross proceeds amount to approximately EUR 8.0 billion. The subscription price was 11.65 euros per share. 98.9 per cent of the subscription rights were exercised. The remaining new shares that were not subscribed will be sold in the market.\nHad the capital increase been completed on 31 December 2016, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio on that date would have been 14.1% on a pro forma CRD4 fully loaded basis rather than 11.8%. Including the capital increase, the pro forma CRD4 fully loaded leverage ratio at year end of 2016 would have been 4.1% rather than 3.5%.\nCommencing Friday, 7 April 2017, the new shares are included in the existing listing of Deutsche Bank shares on the German stock exchanges and on the New York Stock Exchange.\n  IMPORTANT NOTICE\nFor readers in the European Economic Area\nThis release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy or subscribe for, any securities of Deutsche Bank AG. This document does not constitute a prospectus within the meaning of the EC Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council dated 4 November 2003, as amended (the \u201cProspectus Directive\u201d).\nThe public offer in Germany and the United Kingdom will be made solely by means of, and on the basis of, a securities prospectus which was published following its approval by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\nAny investment decision regarding any subscription rights or shares should only be made on the basis of such prospectus which is available for download on the internet site of Deutsche Bank AG (www.db.com/ir).

Accordingly, it cannot be guaranteed that stabilization measures will be taken at all. If stabilization measures are taken, they may be discontinued at any time without prior announcement. Such stabilization measures may be taken on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse) or the New York Stock Exchange as from the date of the publication of the Subscription Offer and must cease at the latest on the 30th calendar day following expiration of the subscription period, expected to be May 6, 2017 (stabilization period).\nStabilization measures may result in a (quoted) market price of the shares of the Company that is higher than would be the case in the absence of such measures. Furthermore, the (quoted) market price may temporarily reach a level that is not sustainable.\nFor readers in the United Kingdom\nThis communication is only being distributed to, and is only directed at, (i) persons who are outside the United Kingdom or (ii) investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the \u201cOrder\u201d) or (iii) high net worth companies falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, or (iv) other persons to whom it may lawfully be communicated, (all such persons together being referred to as \u201crelevant persons\u201d).\nThe new shares are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire such new shares will be engaged in only with, relevant persons.
