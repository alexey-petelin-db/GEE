He joins from Citigroup, where he served as Treasurer, and is expected to assume his new responsibilities at Deutsche Bank in July.\nVon Moltke, 48, succeeds Marcus Schenck, who was appointed Deutsche Bank\u2019s Co-President in early March and who, as previously announced, will oversee the bank\u2019s newly created Corporate & Investment Bank together with Garth Ritchie from July.\nVon Moltke was born in Heidelberg, Germany, and is a dual citizen of Germany and Australia.\nFollowing his studies at Oxford, he started his career at Credit Suisse First Boston in London 25 years ago.
