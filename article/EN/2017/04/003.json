Jos\u00e9 Manuel Mora-Figueroa, COO of Deutsche Bank Spain, received the award along with representatives from nine other major German companies, including ThyssenKrupp (in Spain since 1876), Carl Zeiss (1892), Deutz (1893), Siemens (1895), Bayer (1899), Linde (1907) and Bosch (1908).\nAddressing more than 400 guests, public figures and senior managers from Spanish and German companies, King Felipe said: \"Germany and Spain are friends who share values and interests and who have a similar perspective with regard to the challenges of a global economy\". He continued: \"Today our two countries agree that the only way forward is to strengthen European structures and continue to promote an open Europe for trade.\u201d\nThe King acknowledged the extremely positive nature of Spanish-German business relations. He underlined that German companies established in Spain \"are successful business stories\" directly employing 170,000 people.
