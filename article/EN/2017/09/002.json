    "body": "Nicolas Moreau (pictured, left), Head of Deutsche Asset Management and Member of the Management Board, opened trading on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) today to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the listing of the first Xtrackers exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nDeutsche AM is the largest Europe-based provider of ETFs with multiple listings on the LSE. ETFs are listed mutual funds that combine the benefits of on-exchange trading with the diversity of an investment fund. They typically passively track investment indices.\nXtrackers has an extensive range of emerging markets ETFs and currency-hedged ETFs, and has been first to market in a number of areas \u2013 such as providing exposure to China\u2019s domestic A-shares market in ETF format, for example.\nAfter the market opened, the LSE\u2019s chief executive Nikhil Rathi gave a short speech recognising a decade of successful Xtrackers ETFs listings at the exchange. This was followed by a short speech from Nicolas Moreau.\n\u201cWe have been on a remarkable journey since the launch of those first ETFs back in 2007,\u201d said Moreau. \u201cFrom humble beginnings, our Xtrackers ETFs and exchange-traded commodity ranges have grown in scale and scope, and today we are proud to be one of the leading European asset managers with these products.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe hope that the next 10 years will be even more successful than the last, and we look forward to a continued excellent relationship with the London Stock Exchange and to listing more of our ETFs here in the future.\u201d\nThe opening ceremony at the London Stock Exchange",
