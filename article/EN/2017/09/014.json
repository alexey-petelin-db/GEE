    "body": "Deutsche Bank Wealth Management has been introducing around 100 young clients and guests from around the world to technology entrepreneurs and investors at its second annual Innovation Summit in Los Angeles\u2019 \u201cSilicon Beach\u201d this week.\nThe three-day private event, organised in collaboration with the global corporate venture firm BCG Digital Ventures, included investor panels, discussions with experts on industry trends, and \u201cShark Tank\u201d pitch sessions for start-ups, as well as visits to innovative organisations including XPRIZE.\nFabrizio Campelli, Global Head of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, said: \u201cOur Innovation Summit is a unique opportunity for some of our most entrepreneurial Next Generation clients to explore cutting-edge ideas and technology in one of the world\u2019s most dynamic cities. This week is all about making connections with their peers from around the world along with a fascinating group of investors, entrepreneurs and innovators.\u201d\nSpeakers included Dr. Leon Alkalai, Engineering Fellow at California Institute of Technology (Caltech)\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Founder of AstroLabs; Peter Diamandis, Founder and Chairman of XPRIZE and Co-Founder of the Singularity University; Daniel S.

Digital Ventures is a foundry that aims to bring together world-class corporates with world-class talent -- and that's the ethos of this event.\nJeff Schumacher, CEO and Founder of Manhattan Beach-headquartered BCG Digital Ventures\nThe wealth management business of Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) held its first Next Generation Innovation Summit last year in Silicon Valley, California, the latest extension to a programme for young members of client families that dates back around 15 years.\n\"It's really exciting to work with the Next Generation to explore and navigate the countless opportunities that innovation creates,\" said Salman Mahdi, Vice Chairman at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. \"Now with over 500 alumni in our Next Generation programme, we truly have strong and lasting bonds with an incredibly diverse and talented group of tomorrow's leaders.\"\nThe US West Coast is one of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management's main areas of focus in global plans to hire around 100 client-facing executives this year.\nOther investments Deutsche Bank Wealth Management has announced this year include an additional 65 million euros in new client-focused technology by the end of 2018.
