    "body": "Deutsche Bank and virtual reality \u2013 how do they actually go together? In a new #EconomyViews video, Fred Schuster from the Private & Commercial Bank explains how Deutsche Bank can assist its clients with virtual and augmented reality technologies in future.\n\u201cWe can meet clients in virtual venues, so clients will not have to come to us \u2013 that is a good example,\u201d says Schuster. \u201cThe challenge we face as a bank is enabling clients to understand abstract products.\u201d\nPlay\nVideo\nThe main driver of these developments is the rapid pace of technological progress.\n\u201cThe boundaries between virtual reality and the real world are becoming blurred,\u201d says Schuster. \u201cIn the past it was technology that was the limiting factor. With today\u2019s smartphones we all now have this technology in our pockets.\u201d Over 78 percent of Germans now have a smartphone.\nAugmented reality provides other interesting potential uses.\nUnlike virtual reality, where the user completely blocks out the outside world, augmented reality only integrates virtual elements into the user\u2019s real environment, explains Schuster. Augmented reality, for example, enables clients with questions about their contracts to watch video tutorials or ask for help using their smartphones.",
