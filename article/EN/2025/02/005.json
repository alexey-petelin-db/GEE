    "body": "Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) today published its 2024 Annual Report containing its audited results for the year. There were no divergences from the bank\u2019s 2024 preliminary unaudited results published on January 30, 2025. The Annual Report includes the bank\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2024 Compensation Report and management\u2019s outlook for 2025.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s 2024 Annual Report also contains the bank\u2019s 2024 Sustainability Statement. This provides details of the progress on Deutsche Bank\u2019s sustainability strategy and goals, together with an overview of the bank\u2019s environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks and activities during 2024. \n\u201c2024 was a highly important year for us,\u201d said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe demonstrated Deutsche Bank\u2019s operating strength, grew our business with clients, and acted decisively to reduce our risk profile by putting significant nonoperating costs behind us. Our operating resilience enabled us to keep our promise of increasing capital distributions to shareholders.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cOur outlook for 2025 is positive. We expect continued growth momentum across our businesses in line with our ambition for revenues of around \u20ac 32 billion, boosting profitability as costs and risks normalize, and enabling us to hit our 2025 target for a Return on Tangible Equity above 10%. We also aim to exceed our goal of \u20ac 8 billion in capital distributions to shareholders in respect of the years 2021-2025.\u201d  \n2024: strong underlying performance on the path to achieving 2025 targets\nThe bank\u2019s 2024 audited results confirm its resilient operating performance, characterized by growth in revenues and business volumes, discipline in respect of operating costs, a solid capital ratio and continued growth in distributions to shareholders. The 2024 audited financial results included:\nNet revenues of \u20ac 30.1 billion, growth of 4% over 2023 and 5.8% compound annual growth since 2021, within the bank\u2019s target range of 5.5% to 6.5%\n\nNoninterest expenses of \u20ac 23.0 billion including \u20ac 2.6 billion in nonoperating costs, consisting primarily of \u20ac 1.7 billion in litigation charges for specific matters including the bank\u2019s takeover of Postbank AG. Adjusted costs were down 1% year on year at \u20ac 20.4 billion\n\nProfit before tax of \u20ac 5.3 billion, down 7% year on year, after absorbing higher nonoperating costs driven by specific litigation charges. Profit before tax before nonoperating costs was \u20ac 7.9 billion, up 16% year on year\n\nNet profit of \u20ac 3.5 billion, down 28%, reflecting the aforementioned specific litigation items and the non-recurrence in 2024 of \u20ac 1.0 billion in positive deferred tax asset (DTA) valuation adjustments in 2023\n\nPost-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity (RoTE)1 of 4.7%, or 7.1% excluding the aforementioned specific litigation items, with a cost/income ratio of 76%, or 71% excluding specific litigation items\n\nA Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 13.8% at year-end 2024, up from 13.7% at year-end 2023, and a leverage ratio of 4.6% compared to 4.5% at year-end 2023\n\nCapital distributions to shareholders raised to \u20ac 2.1 billion proposed or authorized for 2025 so far. Proposed dividends of \u20ac 1.3 billion, or \u20ac 0.68 per share for the year 2024, up 50% over 2023, and authorization for share repurchases of \u20ac 750 million in 2025 so far after repurchases of \u20ac 675 million in 2024\n\nCumulative capital distributions since 2022, including those proposed or authorized so far in 2025, rose to \u20ac 5.4 billion; management reaffirmed its aim of cumulative capital distributions in excess of \u20ac 8 billion for the years 2021-2025, to be paid in 2022-2026\n2025 Outlook: financial targets and capital objectives reaffirmed\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s outlook for 2025 reaffirms management\u2019s guidance provided with the publication of the unaudited fourth-quarter 2024 results on January 30, 2025 and includes the following expectations:\nNet revenues are expected to be higher, at around \u20ac 32 billion, in line with the bank\u2019s revenue goal and not including further upside potential from foreign exchange movements1. Within the bank\u2019s businesses:\n\nCorporate Bank revenues are expected to be higher, driven by higher net commissions and fee income and resilient net interest income\n\nInvestment Bank revenues are expected to be higher, driven by slightly higher Fixed Income & Currency (FIC) revenues and significantly higher Origination & Advisory revenues\n\nPrivate Bank revenues are expected to be slightly higher, with growth in investment product revenues, slightly higher deposit revenues and lending revenues essentially flat\n\nAsset Management revenues are expected to be higher, with growth in both management fees and performance and transaction fees\n\nNoninterest expenses are expected to be lower, driven by a significant reduction in nonoperating costs as litigation and restructuring and severance charges are expected to normalize and adjusted costs1 to be essentially flat, with a cost/income ratio which has been reset to below 65% as communicated on January 30, 2025\n\nProvision for credit losses is expected to be lower, at around \u20ac 350 to \u20ac 400 million per quarter on average, as the transitory headwinds experienced in 2024 subside\n\nPost-tax return on tangible equity (RoTE)1 is expected to be above 10%, in line with the bank\u2019s published target, driven primarily by revenue growth and the normalization of nonoperating costs and provision for credit losses\n\nThe CET1 ratio is expected to remain essentially flat compared to 2024\n\nThe bank plans to sustainably grow cash dividends and return capital to shareholders through share buybacks, targeting a payout ratio of 50% of net income attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders\nCompensation Report: 2024 compensation reflects strong operating performance\nTotal compensation awarded to Deutsche Bank employees was \u20ac 11.1 billion in respect of 2024, up from \u20ac 10.3 billion in 2023. Within this total:\nFixed pay was \u20ac 8.1 billion, up from \u20ac 7.9 billion in 2023. This development reflected investments in business growth and controls, the internalization of external contract staff, the hiring of 1,160 graduates and the impact of inflation during 2024, partly offset by operational efficiency savings\n\nYear-end performance-based variable compensation in respect of 2024 was \u20ac 2.5 billion, up from \u20ac 2.0 billion in 2023. This development reflected Deutsche Bank\u2019s strong operating performance including revenue growth, a 16% year on year increase in pre-tax profit before nonoperating costs, and continued growth in proposed or authorized distributions to shareholders\nManagement Board compensation reflected changes introduced in 2024 to reduce complexity, increase transparency and further align Management Board compensation with the long-term interests of shareholders. The Long-Term Incentive component is now determined using a three-year, forward-looking assessment period instead of using past performance as in previous years. Accordingly, the Long-Term Incentive for 2024 will be determined at the end of the performance period 2024-2026.\nCompensation of current Management Board members, on a pro forma basis and assuming 100% achievement of the 2024 Long-Term incentive target over the period 2024-2026, would be \u20ac 68.1 million in 2024. In 2023, compensation for current Management Board members was \u20ac 58.3 million, on an actual basis and reflecting a 77.53% achievement level of the Long-Term Incentive component, calculated on past performance over the period 2021-2023. As such, pro forma figures for 2024 are not directly comparable to the actual compensation levels in previous reports. Management Board compensation reflects performance against the targets set individually for each Management Board member which are set out in detail in the Compensation Report.\nThe Compensation Report, published today on pages 560-611 of the Annual Report, provides further information on Deutsche Bank\u2019s compensation frameworks, policies and governance, together with further details on compensation of Management Board and Supervisory Board members.\nSustainability Statement: progress on multiple fronts in 2024\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s 2024 Sustainability Statement, published on pages 190-367 of the 2024 Annual Report, was prepared according to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) as permitted by the German Commercial Code (HGB). This provides information on the bank\u2019s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) policies, frameworks, activities and progress during 2024. In previous years, large parts of this information were covered by the bank\u2019s Non-Financial Report.\nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank\u2019s progress on its sustainability strategy included:\nGrowth in sustainable Financing and ESG investment volumes2 to \u20ac 373 billion cumulatively since January 1, 2020 (excluding DWS). During 2024, volumes were \u20ac 93 billion, up by 46% from 2023. Progress within the bank\u2019s businesses during 2024 was as follows:\nCorporate Bank: cumulative sustainable financing volumes rose from \u20ac 53 billion to \u20ac 70 billion\n\nInvestment Bank: cumulative sustainable financing and issuance volumes rose from \u20ac 167 billion to \u20ac 224 billion\n\nPrivate Bank: cumulative sustainable financing and ESG investment volumes rose from \u20ac 59 billion to \u20ac 68 billion\nAdditionally, ESG assets under management in DWS rose from \u20ac 133 billion to \u20ac 163 billion during 2024.\nStrengthening frameworks in key areas during 2024. In January, the Sustainable Finance framework was updated and deepened to ensure that the classification of lending and bonds issuance meets best-in-class standards. The bank also published its Sustainable Finance Instrument Framework, which expanded the bank\u2019s Green Financing Framework to include categories of social assets for refinancing. In July, Deutsche Bank issued its inaugural social bond, raising \u20ac500 million, which was 13 times oversubscribed. In November, Deutsche Bank published an ESG Investment Framework which provides transparency on the classification methodology for assets under management.\nDecarbonizing Deutsche Bank\u2019s portfolio. Financed Scope 1 and 2 emissions of clients in the seven key carbon-intensive sectors in Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate loan portfolio covered by net-zero targets fell by 5 percentage points, and Scope 3 emissions by 4 percentage points, compared to year end 2023. This was driven by further reductions from the respective baseline year in several carbon intensive sectors including Power Generation and Steel.\nFrom 2025, aviation will be added as an eighth sector with a carbon pathway target for 2030 (interim) and a net zero target for 2050.\nRating improvements: Deutsche Bank\u2019s progress was recognized in rating improvements from five leading independent agencies during 2024. The bank\u2019s MSCI ESG rating was upgraded from A to AA; the S&P Global Sustainable Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) score improved from 54 to 67 out of 100, placing Deutsche Bank in the top 10% of the agency\u2019s Diversified Financials and Capital Markets sector; the bank\u2019s ISS ESG rating improved to C+ (Prime status) for the first time; the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating improved from 27.9 to 24.8, and the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) Management rating was stable at B, with a score of A or A- in 13 out of 17 categories.\nEmployees: progress on equal opportunities, talent development and governance\nThe bank made further progress on its equal opportunity ambitions. These follow the requirements of Germany\u2019s Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and Second Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Positions Act (Zweites F\u00fchrungspositionengesetz) for female representation at senior levels. In 2024:\n33.0% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President roles were held by women, up from 32.3% in 2023, representing further progress toward the bank\u2019s \u201935 by 25\u2019 program, which aims for 35% of these roles to be held by women by the end of 2025\n\n28.9% of roles reporting directly to Management Board members (Management Board -1), and 28.3% of roles two levels below Management Board (Management Board -2) roles were held by women, representing progress toward the bank\u2019s goal of 30% at both levels\nThe bank\u2019s talent acceleration programs for both Directors and Vice Presidents were expanded in 2024; 526 employees were included in talent acceleration programs, up from 458 in 2023. 42.8% of Director acceleration program participants and 45.5% of Vice President acceleration program participants were women.\nInvestment in talent and development continued during 2024. Employees completed 1.76 million hours of training, of which approximately half were mandatory; The bank hired 1,160 graduates globally in 2024.\nGovernance remained a key area of focus in 2024. Deutsche Bank strengthened its control environment in several key areas in 2024, adding further Anti-Financial Crime specialists and significantly widening staff training. Progress included:\nAppointing a dedicated Chief Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime Officer at Management Board level\n\nHiring further anti-financial crime specialists.
