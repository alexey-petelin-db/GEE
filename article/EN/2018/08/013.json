We\u2019ve already achieved quite a lot here.\u201d\nRead the full dpa article from September 10, 2018 below.\nLehman won\u2019t be repeated\nDeutsche Bank Management Board member Sylvie Matherat\n(dpa-AFX; 10 September 2018) 10 years on from the Lehman bankruptcy, the financial world is considerably more stable according to Deutsche Bank Management Board member Sylvie Matherat. She doesn\u2019t believe that such an event will be repeated again, Matherat told Deutsche Presse-Agentur and financial news agency dpa-AFX in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot since then to stop those sorts of contagion effects and to strengthen the financial system as a whole.\u201d\nThe bankruptcy of US investment bank Lehman Brothers shocked the financial world in mid-September 2008. Banks no longer trusted each other; several institutions faltered. At the height of the trouble, governments stabilised the situation with billions in aid and central banks played their part with a flood of cheap money.\nMatherat, who worked for a supervisory authority for many years, said the causes of the crisis included that \u201cin some areas, the bankers thought too short-term. Accounting rules that allowed quick profits to be achieved in the short term didn\u2019t offer good incentives.\u201d Her suggestion: \u201cWe should discuss whether the concentration on quarterly results might tempt people into short-term thinking. We should think longer term and get away from the short-term view.\u201d\nWhile Europe\u2019s banks still haven\u2019t cleared up the legacy of the financial crisis, the US competition is back making high profits again.\nIt was a good decision by the US government to make banks accept government aid. They did the right thing when they said: we don\u2019t want to lose any time checking whether a bank needs government aid.\nAs for Deutsche Bank, most of the big legal disputes from the time before the 2007/2008 financial crisis have been dealt with, Matherat confirms. \u201cWe\u2019ve left the biggest legal disputes from the past behind us,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re now continuing to improve our internal controls. We\u2019ve already achieved quite a lot here.\u201d\nAnother consequence of the crisis is that regulators and supervisory authorities tightened the reins. The financial sector has since had to follow much stricter rules. Matherat, who has been Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Regulatory Officer since November 2015, says that she doesn\u2019t think that the sector is over-regulated. \u201cHowever, the overall situation should be evaluated. There are not necessarily too many regulations, but whether all the rules are really useful and particularly how they work in combination should be questioned,\u201d Matherat, urged.\nThe fact that, for example, efforts are repeatedly made in the US to undermine stricter rules for banks doesn\u2019t worry Matherat too much. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019ll be a wave of deregulation in the financial sector. It was hard enough to introduce the current regulations.\nApart from the fact that the rules introduced have brought additional certainty, no one who\u2019s experienced it wants to go through the same painful processes in order to undo it all again,\u201d said Matherat. \u201cI expect legislators to remove some of the obstacles to the implementation of the rules that currently exist, but I don\u2019t anticipate general deregulation.\u201d",
