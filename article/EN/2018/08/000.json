    "body": "\u201cMy data really is worth a lot.\u201d Many people are just beginning to grasp this fact, even if they are unable to estimate the precise value of their data. It\u2019s no wonder they would like to retain or regain control of their data and they want to know who is doing what with this data and why.\nSo users of our new Scrollytelling site are invited to chat to avatars Amy, Julian and Marcus about the value of data in the Big Data era; the opportunities for private and business clients to use their bank data for their own ends; about data sovereignty, data privacy and data security \u2013 and about how banks handle data differently to the internet giants.\nThe three fictitious characters reflect the views of our diverse clientele and ask important, critical questions \u2013 and our experts provide the answers.\nRen\u00e9 W. Keller, Deutsche Bank Head of Data and Innovation, puts it in a nutshell: \u201cFor a bank it's all about trust. Clients entrust us with their money. They entrust us with their personal information. So we have to handle their data with the utmost care.\u201d",
