    "body": "Deutsche Bank\u2019s (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) Management Board has appointed Frank Kuhnke as new Chief Operating Officer (COO). He will be responsible for technology and central operations, including information security, data management, digital transformation and corporate services. Kuhnke succeeds Kim Hammonds who, as previously announced, will leave the bank after this year\u2019s Annual General Meeting.\nAdditionally, the Management Board appointed Kuhnke as a Senior Group Director (\u201cGeneralbevollm\u00e4chtigter\u201d). The Supervisory Board agreed on the appointment. Kuhnke will report into Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and will regularly attend the meetings of the Management Board.\nKuhnke joined Deutsche Bank in 1986 and, since January 2016, has been Divisional Control Officer, Chief Administrative Officer and Head of Operations of the Private & Commercial Bank. During his career he has worked across several business divisions and infrastructure functions in Tokyo, London, New York and Germany.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s CEO Christian Sewing said: \u201cIn his tenure at Deutsche Bank of more than three decades Frank Kuhnke has proven that he is strong at taking decisions and executing them. He is able to systematically make complex processes and structures more efficient. Together with his team he will continue simplifying our bank\u2019s technology and operations, cut costs and strengthen our innovation potential. We have been working together closely for many years, and I am looking forward to continuing our journey together.\u201d\nAbout Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank provides commercial and investment banking, retail banking, transaction banking and asset and wealth management products and services to corporations, governments, institutional investors, small and medium-sized businesses, and private individuals.
