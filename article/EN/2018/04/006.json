    "body": "Annual General Meeting\nFrankfurt am Main, 24 May 2018\nSpeech of Paul Achleitner\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\nDeutsche Bank AG\n\u2013 Check against delivery \u2013\nDear Shareholders,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nDear Guests,\nWhether you are actually here with us in Frankfurt or watching on the internet or TV \u2013 I would like to warmly welcome you all to today's Annual General Meeting of Deutsche Bank AG.\nI would also like to extend a warm welcome to the Eintracht Frankfurt supporters amongst you \u2013 as a Munich resident, I feel a special need to congratulate you on winning the German Cup Final.\nDeutsche Bank also frequently finds itself the subject of football analogies \u2013 Champions League vs. Europa League, team players vs. individualists, substituting a player vs. replacing the manager.\nThat is why I have a photo with me today that I took on Saturday \u2013 I would like to take my cue from what it depicts, because I was very impressed by the fighting spirit of the Eintracht Frankfurt players.\nLadies and Gentlemen,believe it or not, I\u2019m looking forward to today\u2019s dialogue with you.\nOf course, I am expecting there to be some criticism, and looking at the share price of Deutsche Bank \u2013 your Deutsche Bank, our Deutsche Bank \u2013 there can be no other logical reaction.\nI am nevertheless grateful to be able to provide transparency about the work of your Supervisory Board in the forum that has been stipulated for this purpose by German corporate law \u2013 the Annual General Meeting. The work of a Supervisory Board isn\u2019t just some kind of reality TV show. The work of a German supervisory board member must be performed on the basis of confidentiality and trust.\nThose who for whatever reason show little regard for that strict confidentiality, subject as it is to sanctions under criminal law, are thus always better at \u201ctelling stories\u201d than those of us who play by the rules.\nWith the exception of today, because here we may \u2013 in fact, we are obliged to \u2013 transparently answer your questions, dear shareholders, and we trust that during today\u2019s meeting we can put right some of the assertions that are being made.\nLadies and Gentlemen, what we cannot put right is our share price or the results of our bank. These are the main reasons for your dissatisfaction, I accept, and these are the main reasons why we exercised our authority by taking responsive action.\nWe did this based on the firm conviction that the reorganisation of Deutsche Bank will now gather pace \u2013 but I\u2019ll expand on this shortly.\nIn the hope that a transparent and critical but fair discussion will follow, I hereby open today\u2019s annual General Meeting.\nReport of the Supervisory Board\nDear Shareholders,\nWe undoubtedly all agree on one thing: we at Deutsche Bank still have a long way to go to reach our target! For a while, things did look much better.\nWhen we met here one year ago, our Deutsche Bank had just completed a successful capital increase, the stock price was 16.80 euros, and we were looking ahead with confidence. Even after three quarters of 2017 and despite several additional balance sheet adjustments, pre-tax profit amounted to 2.6 billion euros \u2013 which is not our medium-term target, but all the same.\nThen the situation worsened \u2013 due in no small measure to the US tax reform, but also due to factors of our own making.\nThe fourth quarter brought weak results: with revenues down sharply while costs rose \u2013 not only due to accounting factors such as the tax reform, but also because of the operating performance of our bank. And there were no indications of a turnaround in the results expected for the first quarter of this year.\nAs you can expect, we on the Supervisory Board and the Chairman's Committee in particular deliberated extensively regarding \u201cthe reasons why\u201d. What we identified were shortcomings in decision-making and implementation which, despite numerous discussions with the Management Board, first and foremost with the Chief Executive Officer, did not become any smaller.\nInstead we observed increasing differences of opinion and conflicts within management.\nOur main criticism was that well formulated plans and promised measures had not been executed with sufficient discipline or rigour. We found that exceptions were made for many rules. And we gained the impression that these exceptions were sometimes applied more often than the rules themselves.\nAn alarming symptom was cost development \u2013 and the most striking element was in the size of our workforce.\nThe good news is that some areas did exercise the necessary discipline:\nThe partial IPO of DWS was rigorously prepared and executed under the leadership of Nicolas Moreau.\nThe same applies to the imminent merger between Postbank and the private and commercial banking business of Deutsche Bank, which has been driven by Christian Sewing and Frank Strau\u00df and whose completion we expect before the end of this quarter.\nAnd our Corporate & Investment Bank is better placed in many segments than it might seem on the outside.\nBut this wasn\u2019t enough. The bank reported an unexpected loss for 2017 as well.\nDear shareholders, you are right to expect the bank, and its management, to hit the targets it has set itself. If there are signs that these targets are in jeopardy \u2013 and recently this was unfortunately clearly the case \u2013 then we on the Supervisory Board have to act swiftly and decisively.\nWhich is why we decided to reshuffle the team. To the considerable detriment of our bank and our irritation, these measures, which also required regulatory approval, were overshadowed for a whole week over Easter by all sorts of speculation.\nA lot of what you read then had little or nothing to do with the truth. All of a sudden people were being named as potential successors who were never even in contention.\nWhoever may have benefited from this, it did great harm to our bank and the standing of the people concerned, not least John Cryan and myself. The situation that developed over the Easter period threatened to cause further harm to the bank, both inside the company and in our interaction with clients. This had to be averted.\nWe had to act \u2013 even though it wasn\u2019t originally our intention to make the change so swiftly. Personally, I had hoped that the reshuffle at the top of our bank would be made in a constructive spirit at today's Annual General Meeting.\nInstead, the Supervisory Board appointed Christian Sewing to succeed John Cryan as Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank on April 8. This appointment was made just six working days after the first media article. During this period my focus was on the flow of information and how opinions were forming within the Supervisory Board as well as the required coordination with our regulators.\nOnly once this was completed did we make a public disclosure in accordance with regulatory and procedural requirements.\nEven though I can understand the critics\u2019 desire for a public statement to have been made earlier, there are strict rules governing this, too.\nI want to reiterate this point: the public debate merely brought forward a decision that a large majority of the Supervisory Board already regarded as unavoidable. But we would all have preferred for this change to have taken place without these public debates.\nThey overshadowed a lot of other things. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to give a full and detailed appraisal of the work of John Cryan: he was the right man for the bank during this particular phase. He took on the operational responsibility for our bank nearly three years ago when a credible new start was required from the head of the Management Board. A new start that no internal successor could have effected at that time.\nMr Cryan did an excellent job in accomplishing this mission, he set the ball rolling for fundamental change. He identified the problems by name and together with his Management Board colleagues made important progress. He and his team \u2026\n\u2026 made major improvements to controls and the underlying systems\n\u2026 and resolved major litigation cases \u2013 with special thanks also due to our Management Board member in charge of Legal matters Karl von Rohr, who is now also one of our Presidents.\nAt the same time the team \u2026\n\u2026 has improved relationships with our regulators\n\u2026 and sustainably strengthened our balance sheet and capital base.\nThe object was to reduce the overall complexity of the bank to make it less vulnerable. We discontinued individual business activities such as commodities trading and exited 10 countries. Recently the Management Board agreed to dispose of our private and commercial banking businesses in Portugal and Poland in order to focus more on other countries such as Italy and Spain.\nSo John Cryan\u2019s tenure was marked by a number of key strategic achievements that have laid the foundations on which Christian Sewing and his team can now build. You could say that the tracks have been laid and now the train just has to pick up speed.\nEven though it would have been desirable for all concerned to execute this change under other circumstances, I would like to reiterate that Mr Cryan performed outstandingly for our bank. I would like to take this opportunity to thank him very much \u2013 and I know that I also speak for the entire Supervisory Board in expressing this gratitude \u2013 and I hope I am also speaking for you, dear shareholders.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nFormer Deutsche Bank CEO Alfred Herrhausen once said: \u201cWe must say what we think. We must do what we say. We must also be what we do.\u201d In Christian Sewing, we have a CEO who not only says what he thinks, but also \u201cdoes\u201d and to a certain degree \u201cis\u201d Deutsche Bank. He has proved this in almost 30 years working for our bank.\nIt was particularly important for us that Christian Sewing possesses this wealth of experience. It is our firm conviction that we need someone at the top of our bank who has deep knowledge of the bank's internal workings in order to push on with the reorganisation that is still required \u2013 with an eye for the big picture, on the one hand, but also with the necessary detailed knowledge, on the other. That is why the Supervisory Board \u2013 from the outset \u2013 had a clear preference for an internal successor.\nAnd we made an early start in preparing suitable candidates, as you know. A professional personnel decision also involves comparing internal candidates with possible external alternatives. We also did this with the assistance of an external expert.\nAllow me to make a comment in this context: in the end, there were indeed two serious external candidates, whose names, fortunately, were not cause for speculation by the media. But we quite deliberately decided to opt for the \u201cinternal\u201d solution.\nFor this reason, allow me to state clearly once again: Christian Sewing is our first choice. Our decision to appoint him was not because he\u2019s a retail banker, or because he\u2019s an investment banker, but because he\u2019s a Deutsche-banker.\nChristian Sewing is Deutsche Bank to the core and knows every area of the organisation, from so many different perspectives, like no one else.\nHe began his apprenticeship at Deutsche Bank in Bielefeld in 1989 and subsequently worked in various roles in Europe, Asia and America. As a risk manager, he developed an in-depth knowledge of our bank through the different business divisions and proved himself in all of the positions he has held.\nIn June 2013, Christian Sewing was appointed Head of Group Audit, also with the approval of the entire Supervisory Board, which during the first 12 months of my tenure had previous regular interactions with him in his role as Deputy Chief Risk Officer on Risk Committee matters. Examples such as the detailed analysis of the Libor crisis quickly made it clear to me that Christian Sewing is someone that we could rely on and whose career we should continue to develop.\nThe Supervisory Board then appointed him to the Management Board at the beginning of 2015, assigning responsibility for the private and commercial banking business to him shortly afterwards. In March 2017, we appointed him as President. We have closely monitored and supported his development as a leader.\nSo while we needed someone from outside the bank back in 2015 \u2013 someone who would represent a new beginning and analyse the bank relentlessly \u2013 the focus now is on implementing the knowledge we have gained even more rigorously.\nEspecially given the fact that Christian Sewing is familiar with all aspects of the bank, we believe that he will now drive the necessary transformation forward swiftly and sustainably.\nHis two deputies, Karl von Rohr and Garth Ritchie, have also had a long tenure at the bank: 21 and 22 years, respectively.\nWhy do we have deputies at all \u2013 considering that Mr Sewing is still young? The job of the Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank is so comprehensive and time-consuming that it seems appropriate to appoint persons at both the international and national levels who can deputise for the CEO with the corresponding authority.\nMr Sewing, Mr von Rohr and Mr Ritchie have worked together for decades and know and trust each other. They have first-hand knowledge of where the bank\u2019s weaknesses, but also its strengths, lie.\nAnd it is precisely these strengths that we need to focus on again:\na strong brand, steeped in tradition,\noutstanding employees worldwide,\nlong-standing client relationships\nand a solid capital position which provides Deutsche Bank with the necessary stability and scope for growth.\nBefore I got to know it from the inside, I knew Deutsche Bank as a competitor, client, negotiating partner and service provider during the course of my own professional career.\nI have always perceived Deutsche Bank to be a proud and competent institution \u2013 a bank that is aware of its role and significance for Germany and Europe, and acts in the interests of its clients in a resolute and decisive manner. The foundations for this have remained unchanged. Now we have to bring them to life.\nIt is true that recognition has to be earned. It cannot be decreed; rather, if a reputation has been damaged, it has to be reconstructed by means of many \u2013 often small \u2013 steps.\nIt is true that it will certainly continue to take some time until clients, the general public and shareholders respect the bank again in the way that it and its employees deserve.\nThis is precisely the reason why we had to act when the bank failed to meet key targets. It is precisely why we could not wait patiently in the hope that things would somehow improve.\nChristian Sewing will shortly be presenting the Management Board\u2019s current plans for getting Deutsche Bank back on course.\nFor differing reasons, Marcus Schenck and Kim Hammonds will no longer be part of this team. In carrying out their crucial roles over the past few years, they also laid the key foundations on which their successors can now build.\nKim Hammonds has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the bank\u2019s technologies are working towards fulfilling the expectations that our employees and clients place on them.\nIt is true that there is still some way to go in this area. Kim Hammonds has established a first-class team that will be working together with our new Chief Operating Officer Frank Kuhnke to improve our bank\u2019s technical processes and bring them up to speed.\nAs far as stability is concerned, once again, we are top of the league. Key applications were available at a rate of 99.994 percent in 2017 \u2013 this is the most stable the bank\u2019s IT systems have ever been. We also have Kim Hammonds to thank for this and wish her every success in her future career.\nMarcus Schenck performed a great service to Deutsche Bank, not only as Chief Financial Officer, but also as a \u201cclient man\u201d. He is a trusted advisor for many clients, and not just in German industry; he is a banker whom clients, competitors and employees highly respect.\nWe regret, but respect, his decision to leave Deutsche Bank. He will be a hard act to follow, especially when it comes to his expertise in the field of corporate finance. We also wish him all the best for the next stage in his impressive career.\nLadies and Gentlemen, that concludes what I have to say regarding the reorganisation of the Management Board. We wish all those involved, and especially the Board as a whole, every success in the interests of our bank, its clients and employees, and it goes without saying, its investors.\nSo, turning now to the Report of the Supervisory Board:\nAs you have all noticed, there has been a series of indiscretions concerning the position of the new Chief Executive Officer. German corporate law rightly regards the unauthorised disclosure of such information as a criminal dereliction of duty. The bank will consequently therefore file a charge against unknown persons in this matter.\nThe activities of the Supervisory Board are required to take place in an atmosphere of trust and confidence. Even if it recently appeared otherwise, this was also largely the case in the year under review.\nLast year we held 49 committee and 10 plenary meetings. A further 22 meetings in total have been held since the start of this year.\nDear Shareholders, you will find detailed information on the key activities performed by the Supervisory Board in the 2017 reporting year on pages VI to XIV of our Annual Report.\nHere are some of the points that I would like to highlight:\nAs I have reported here on several occasions, Deutsche Bank has in recent years faced a series of supervisory investigations and regulatory penalties, whose causes originated from the period before the 2007 financial crisis in some cases. In accordance with aspects of German corporate law, the Supervisory Board is obliged to examine whether the bank can hold Management Board members personally liable who were in office during that time. We looked into this matter extensively.\nAccording to the current findings of these investigations, there is insufficient factual and legal basis for actionable damages claims against the officiating Management Board members of that time.\nThe Supervisory Board has decided on that basis not to hold the Management Board members personally liable.\nIn the course of an agreement with the Supervisory Board, eleven members of the Management Board who served during the financial crisis and thereafter have voluntarily waived their entitlement to a total of 38.4 million euros still owed to them by the bank. This amounts to 55 percent of their entitlement.\nThis is a further contribution they have made toward overcoming problems resulting from the past, and I would like to express my sincere thanks for the constructive discussions that led to this outcome.\nWe have extensively addressed not only compensation issues relating to former Management Board members, but also current compensation issues, as in years gone by. In that context, allow me to start by informing you that the compensation system 97 percent of you, our shareholders, approved at last year\u2019s Annual General Meeting is working well.\nIn our Compensation Report on pages 138 to 180 of our 2017 Annual Report, you will see that for the long-term variable compensation component, the achievement level was 38 percent on average, and for the short-term Group target it was 45 percent.\nBut still, the Management Board decided to waive its variable compensation for 2017 in light of the unexpected loss. This was the third consecutive year of doing so. This decision was not the result of any informal pressure from the Supervisory Board \u2013 nor would that have been justified. The waiver was a voluntary act and this decision to protect the bank does credit to the Management Board.\nAs we promised last year, we are making our Management Board compensation system even more transparent. The Compensation Report contains information on the main criteria of the appraisal system.\nOne of the main tasks of the Nomination Committee in 2017 was to select those individuals who we will be presenting to you today as candidates for the Supervisory Board.\nFour shareholder representatives will be leaving the Supervisory Board:\nDina Dublon and Louise Parent have informed us that they will not be standing for another mandate period.\nProfessor Henning Kagermann\u2019s departure is age-related.\nDr Johannes Teyssen \u2013 as he announced some time ago \u2013 will not be standing for election after having already served for two mandate periods.\nAnd so we have large gaps to fill \u2013 not only in terms of the expertise profile but also in terms of the personalities we will be losing. We have given these issues considerable thought, consulted external advisors and held a number of talks and interviews.\nThis year I would also like to give the new candidates being proposed for appointment to the Supervisory Board the opportunity to briefly introduce themselves, and I will do this when addressing Agenda Item 8. Now, however, I would like to outline the particularly important considerations for us on the Nomination Committee.\nFirst, we looked into filling the role that Ms Dublon has performed so very well for the past five years: Risk Committee Chairperson.\nDina, our sincere thanks once again; you discharged this responsibility with vigour and authority.\nDear shareholders, we are proud to be able to propose Mayree Clark, who has more than 24 years\u2019 experience of working in the financial sector, as a member of the Supervisory Board and the new Risk Committee Chairperson.\nLouise Parent headed the Integrity Committee in recent years and has made a significant contribution towards the resolution of many legal issues \u2013 often a thankless task. We are extremely grateful to her.\nIn Professor Stefan Simon, we already have a skilled lawyer on the Supervisory Board. He has now taken over as Chairman of the Integrity Committee and is to succeed Professor Kagermann on the Chairman\u2019s Committee. So, instead of nominating another lawyer, we decided to look for an expert on banking technology and operations.\nWe found what we were looking for in Michele Trogni, who is also standing for election to the Supervisory Board here today.\nMs Trogni is a world leader in her field. We are sure that she will play a valuable role as the Chairperson of our new Innovation and Technology Committee.\nLast year, we announced that Professor Norbert Winkeljohann would join the Supervisory Board as a replacement for Professor Kagermann so that we can continue to strengthen our expertise in finance and accounting.\nProfessor Kagermann, you have been on the bank\u2019s Supervisory Board for 18 years, as well as the Chairman\u2019s Committee since October 2013, where you became known for your rigorous reasoning as well as your expertise and experience. We were always able to rely on you and we owe you our gratitude and sincere thanks for your dedication and loyalty to Deutsche Bank.\nLadies and gentlemen, Professor Winkeljohann is currently still employed at PwC. We take potential conflicts of interests extremely seriously. That is one of the reasons why Professor Winkeljohann is to be appointed with effect from August 1 and we are asking you to vote for Ms Dublon to remain on the Supervisory Board for the next two months or so.\nAnd finally, we needed to find someone to replace Dr Teyssen. Given that the Supervisory Board has to oversee the complex reorganisation of our Corporate & Investment Bank, we were looking for someone with experience in international finance \u2013 someone with expert knowledge of the trading business and regulatory issues. Furthermore, he or she would be assuming the Chair of our new Strategy Committee so they would need to be able to oversee in particular the Management Board measures for focusing the Corporate & Investment Bank with an expert eye.\nWe would like to thank John Thain for agreeing to take on this responsibility at our bank.\nHis knowledge of the sector is second to none and he also has significant experience of the many ups and downs common in our business. We very highly value the experience he brings.\nLast but not least, Alexander Sch\u00fctz, a representative of our major shareholder HNA, is also nominated for re-election today. He introduced himself last year, so you will already know him.\nThe following employee representatives will also join the Supervisory Board as new members:\nMr Ludwig Blomeyer-Bartenstein\nMr Detlef Polaschek\nMr Stephan Szukalski, who already served on the Supervisory Board between May 2013 and November 2015\nWe look forward to working with you and are sure that we will successfully maintain the trusting collaboration between shareholder and employee representatives in the interest of our bank.\nAllow me \u2013 also on your behalf, our valued shareholders \u2013 to thank those employee representatives leaving the Supervisory Board:\nMr Rudsch\u00e4fski, you were unfortunately not my Deputy for long but spent eight years as Deputy Chairman of the bank\u2019s General Workers\u2019 Council. We would like to thank you for your dedication and wish you good health.\nMs Irrgang \u2013 we will miss you!\nThe level of personal commitment you showed to the bank and to its employees was exemplary. And you were a great source of support in the Integrity Committee in particular.\nMr Boehr, the work of the Risk Committee is especially taxing; your contribution was always constructive. Your fundamental knowledge of Deutsche Bank was of the utmost value to us. Thank you.\nLadies and Gentlemen, there has been a public debate about whether our Supervisory Board still needs a representative from German industry.\nGenerally speaking, I am very much in favour of this but actually arranging this is not that easy. Major hurdles in this context are both the time and effort needed and the regulatory restrictions.\nAnd there is also the valid discussion about the number of Supervisory Board mandates individuals should exercise.\nEven without a dedicated industry representative on the Supervisory Board, though, I can assure you that in our bank there is no shortage of understanding of Germany and its corporate landscape \u2013 just look at the Management Board.\nBut the composition of our Supervisory Board also mirrors the focus of our bank: the fact that 75 percent of its members come from German-speaking regions underlines the close connection to the home market. At the same time, we are bringing additional experience of international banking and the capital markets into the Supervisory Board with these newly proposed members \u2013 because that is the second, equally indispensable aspect of Deutsche Bank.\nRooted in Germany and Europe, but at the same time with a global outlook and at home in the capital markets around the globe \u2013 this combination is the essence of Deutsche Bank\u2019s identity. This strategic template was, is and will remain the right one \u2013 the Supervisory Board has always supported the Management Board in this stance.\nThis doesn\u2019t, however, mean that management will rigidly stick to one structure \u2013 it has to adapt flexibly and tactically to the environment within the guidelines it has agreed. The Management Board has to constantly reassess this, and it is then responsible for implementing its decisions \u2013 without blinkers and with our advice and under our supervision.\nWe can, however, assure you that we fully support the strategic direction that the new Management Board resolved under the leadership of Christian Sewing shortly after he took up his new position.\nOn that note, let me now hand over to our new Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing.\nThank you.",
