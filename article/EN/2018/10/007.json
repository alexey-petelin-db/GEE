Finding the best startup opportunities across Asia Pacific, through Singapore, to scale globally across the bank\u2019s platform will be a key objective for Deutsche Bank\u2019s Asia Pacific Innovation Lab. Similarly, Singapore\u2019s addition to the platform will ensure that the innovation needs of the bank\u2019s Asia Pacific businesses are plugged into its global innovation platform.\nOpening the Lab, Deutsche Bank Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer, Werner Steinmueller, said: \u201cAsia, particularly Singapore, is proving to be fertile ground for talented startups and we are very excited about the potential for partnerships here. The establishment of our newest Innovation Lab in Singapore is just the latest expression of our continued commitment and investment in our Asia Pacific platform, where we see abundant opportunity.\u201d\nMs Jacqueline Loh, Deputy Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), who officiated at the launch said:\nMAS is committed to fostering a thriving innovation ecosystem.
