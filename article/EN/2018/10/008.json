    "body": "How can we promote better education? Strengthen neighbourhoods? Enable inclusion? More than 80 social entrepreneurs, experts and academics met in Frankfurt to discuss ideas and solutions to pressing societal challenges \u2013 bringing the Sustainable Development Goal \u201cPartnership\u201d to life.\n\u201cThe event marked the kick-off for the new Global Goals Lab series, our latest Made for Good enterprise programme. Together with our valued partner Social Impact, it bundles previous modules available to social entrepreneurs, aligns them with our own CSR agenda as well as the UN Agenda 2030 \u2013 a plan of action to shift the world onto a more sustainable and resilient path\u201d, says Alexander Gallas, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility Germany.\nStay tuned: In late November, eight selected social enterprises will meet for the next module of the Global Goals Lab near Berlin to further fine-tune their business portfolio \u2013 again with the help of dedicated experts, among them many Deutsche Bank volunteers. All participants can then apply for the Global Goals Impact Fund and engage as many fans as they can in an online voting before an expert jury picks six finalists who can pitch for non-repayable grants in February 2019 in Bonn.",
