    "body": "All Deutsche Bank customers can use Apple Pay with \u201cDeutsche Bank Card Virtual\u201d or add their existing credit and debit cards\nVirtual card integrated in the Deutsche Bank Mobile app incurs no monthly fee and is available to all customers without a Deutsche Bank Card Plus\nNew clients can open a new account in just a few minutes with no account fees charged until June 30, 2019\nToday Deutsche Bank brings its customers Apple Pay, which is transforming mobile payments with an easy, secure and private way to pay that\u2019s fast and convenient.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s objective is to enable its clients to make purchases using Apple Pay. With just a few clicks in the Deutsche Bank Mobile app, existing or new customers without a Mastercard can apply for the \u201cDeutsche Bank Card Virtual\u201d, which allows them to use Apple Pay straight from their bank account. The virtual card can be used the following day, but soon it will be issued instantly. It comes without a membership fee and is available to all customers without a Deutsche Bank Card Plus. Customers can also add their existing Mastercard debit and credit cards to their Apple Wallet. The first 30,000 users to sign up for the new service will receive a ten-euro voucher from Deutsche Bank to use in the App Store and the iTunes store. People who are interested in the new service but do not yet have a Deutsche Bank account may open one online or at a branch in a matter of minutes. New AktivKonto clients incur no account fees until June 30, 2019.\nSecurity and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. When you use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code.\nPhilipp Gossow, Head of Deutsche Bank Private Clients Germany, said at the launch of Apple Pay at Deutsche Bank: \u201cToday we are Germany's main digital bank with an award-winning mobile app, multi-bank aggregation and innovations such as photo and SEPA real-time payments. Now that we\u2019re offering Apple Pay, all our clients can join the revolution in mobile payments.\u201d\nApple Pay is easy to set up and users will continue to receive all of the rewards and bene\ufb01ts offered by Deutsche Bank credit and debit cards. In stores, Apple Pay works with iPhone SE, iPhone 6 and later, and Apple Watch.\nOnline shopping in apps and on websites accepting Apple Pay is simple with Touch ID, or just double-click the side button and glance at your iPhone X to authenticate with Face ID. There is no need to manually fill out lengthy account forms or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information with Apple Pay. When paying for goods and services on the go in apps or Safari, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6 and later, iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad (5th Generation and later), iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later. You can also use Apple Pay in Safari on any Mac introduced in or after 2012 running macOS Sierra and confirm the payment with iPhone 6 or later or Apple Watch, or with Touch ID on the new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.",
