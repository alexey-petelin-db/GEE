    "body": "This week\u2019s US midterm elections will impact trade, tariffs and markets, Christian Nolting, Chief Investment Officer for Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, told CNBC while guest hosting its flagship Squawk Box show in Europe on Monday.\nIf the Democrats win a majority in the US House of Representatives, \u201cthere could be some negotiation going on which is positive for trade,\u201d Nolting said. If the Republicans maintain their majority, trade disputes and tariffs may increase, he said.\nThe US markets are poised to react to either scenario and \u201clots of markets have quite a high beta to this, so I think it\u2019s an important topic\u201d for international investors, Nolting said.\nRegardless of the election results, \u201cwhat will probably be discussed after the midterms is infrastructure investments and that\u2019s something to really have a look at,\u201d the CIO said.\nClick image below to watch the interview.\nPlay\nVideo",
