    "body": "Dear Colleagues,\nIn the third quarter we continued to deliver on what we promised in April. We are well on track to achieve our first profitable year since 2014.\nIn particular, we made headway on our cost reductions. We are very confident that we will meet our 2018 targets. On the other hand we have not yet achieved a turnaround in terms of revenues. We must therefore sustain our efforts to grow revenues across our businesses.\nWhat we\u2019ve achieved in the past six months has been remarkable:\n\u2014 There\u2019s a new spirit of discipline in our bank which is also visible in our numbers. This is a prerequisite to improving our credit ratings and achieving a better share price in the future. And you can be sure that we are doing everything possible to prevent a cost increase in the fourth quarter which we have seen too often in the past.\n\u2014 Our solid results in the third quarter are primarily due to lower costs and lower provisions for credit losses. The front office adjustments in our Corporate & Investment Bank \u2013 now largely completed \u2013 also played a role, costing us some revenues. Now we are in the position to get back on the front foot.\n\u2014 Going forward, we can focus on growth as our balance sheet has rarely been stronger. With a CET 1 ratio of 14 percent and excess liquidity of 76 billion euros, we have created firm foundations for our client business.\nOur pre-tax profit of 506 million euros in the quarter is a milestone on the road back to sustainable profitability. For the first nine months the number is 1.6 billion euros \u2013 that\u2019s your success.\nWe have to build on this momentum to meet the announced target of a 4 percent post-tax return on tangible equity next year.\nThe prospects are good. The past few months have proven how much corporates, institutional investors and private clients are willing to work with us and how good and stable our client relationships are. Here are just a few examples:\n\u2014 We\u2019ve seen outstanding successes in our origination and advisory business, having had leading roles in six of the ten biggest transactions by fee volume in the third quarter. In Europe we\u2019ve had global coordinator roles in four out of the five biggest IPOs in 2018, making us the market leader this year. And we have a robust pipeline of transactions in our books. These are great achievements by the different teams.\n\u2014 Despite lower revenues, our investment bank is well on track in important areas. In Leveraged Finance, our market share is higher than a year ago. In Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC), we have gained ground versus the previous quarter.\n\u2014 Our global transaction bank has bought a share in US startup Modo, whose technology will allow us to process payments via non-banking platforms like Alipay, Paypal, M-Pesa and WeChat going forward \u2013 a key growth area within the payment sector. In Trade Finance, we\u2019ll be working with six other banks on a \u2018Trade Information Network\u2019 platform. The revenues in our GTB business are not yet where we want them to be. But we are strongly determined to expand GTB as one of our core revenue engines under the new leadership of Stefan Hoops.\n\u2014 We have grown loan volumes by 7 billion euros in the quarter in our core businesses. Of this amount, 3 billion euros is attributable to our Private & Commercial Bank. At the same time, we continue to make good progress with the merger of Deutsche Bank and Postbank in our home market. We will announce the new management structure of our head office and infrastructure organisation shortly.\n\u2014 Our asset manager DWS has consistently increased its pre-tax profit since the IPO. During the third quarter, DWS signed a partnership with Tikehau Capital, which specialises in alternative investments. The French asset manager took part in DWS\u2019s IPO earlier this year. In addition, we will expand our cooperation with the Italian insurer Generali, positioning DWS as one of its preferred asset managers for the distribution of investment policies throughout Europe.\nAll of this shows that our clients count on us. Whether it\u2019s the risk of a trade war or Brexit, elevated public debt in many countries around the world, or rising volatility in the markets \u2013 it\u2019s precisely in times of uncertainty that we can prove ourselves as successful advisors and risk managers for our clients. We have unique expertise in many areas and we should turn this to our clients\u2019 advantage.\nWe can take some pride in what we have achieved over the past few months. However, there\u2019s no reason to let up. On the contrary: we need to end the year on a strong note.\nWe\u2019ll stay disciplined on costs, and we\u2019ll turn around revenues \u2013 without compromising on our controls or our values. What we\u2019ve achieved so far this year makes me optimistic. Let\u2019s stay the course.\nBest wishes,\nChristian",
