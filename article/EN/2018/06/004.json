    "body": "Being diagnosed with cancer is a shock that hits you hard. It\u2019s also a time when you are desperately seeking information, support and inspiration from those fighting the same battles.\nThis was the inspiration behind the bank\u2019s third 24-hour Hackathon. In support of Cure Leukaemia, one of the bank\u2019s UK Charities of the Year, over 800 volunteers from across the bank\u2019s technical staff competed around the clock to design and develop prototypes of a mobile app to support Leukaemia patients.\n\u2018She Hacks!\u2019 an all-female winning team based in London, developed a prototype called Sanguine, derived from the Latin for blood - and also a term for being positive. Using a friendly interface and clever programming, the app suggests \u201cbuddies\u201d with similar diagnoses, age and gender. It also curates articles from trusted sources and keeps track of a patient\u2019s well-being and key statistics. Patients can choose to share this information with friends, family, buddies or doctors, as well as fetch blood test results and report their daily progress.\n\nThe She Hacks! team with Paul Shepheard, Group CIO, and James Mclaughlin Cure Leukaemia CEO\nCommenting on their victory, She Hacks! said: \u201cIt was a lot of fun to pull together across a diverse range of technical perspectives and seniorities to produce a prototype solution that focussed on the needs of leukaemia patients, their families and carers. We all worked on something new in terms of technologies or platforms, splitting our responsibilities across design, user interface, backend, release and even automated testing.\n\u201cAs an all-female team with a range of technical backgrounds, everyone in the team had an important part to play.\u201d\nOpening the event on 19 July at 13:00 CET, Frank Kuhnke, Group Chief Operating Officer, said. \"Events like this reflect the bank\u2019s ambition to be a tech-led company and to be innovative. Cure Leukaemia is a brilliant cause and I hope the teams have fun and build contacts that last above and beyond the Hackathon.\u201d\nCurrent and former leukaemia patients joined the Hackathon in London, sharing their experiences and offering the teams a unique sounding board for ideas about how to develop the app. Brooke Evans, who was diagnosed with Leukaemia at 18 and is now in remission, said: \u201cI know only too well how much it means to have someone to talk to and all the mountains of lengthy but useful information you are given. I\u2019m so glad I had the chance to share my story and hopefully make a difference to more patients by being that success story and giving people hope.\u201d\nThe global event saw multidisciplinary teams take part in the UK, India, Romania, Germany, Hong Kong, US, Russia and Singapore. In London, each of the teams was joined by young women from the bank\u2019s Student to STEMette (Science, Technology, Engineering or Maths) programme and engineering students from the Arkwright Scholarship Trust.\nA panel of judges from across the bank evaluated the prototypes based on four categories. A winning team from each country was shortlisted and a winner chosen in each category.\nCategories  Winning Teams\nBest User Experience: She Hacks!

Both events showcase the bank\u2019s technical talent, collaborative spirit, innovation and societal impact across its global teams.\nWinning team members - She Hacks: Neha Thakur, Jovita Pereira, Dilara Okci, Natalie Spooner, Pippa Newbold, Emma Wansbrough, Milena Georgieva, Tia Nasir (STEMette), Kiara Takeuchi (Arkwright Scholar), Shijun Zeng (Graduate)\nMore information about the winning application, how the Hackathon was put together and the technology behind it will follow over the coming weeks.\nUK Charities of the Year\nCure Leukaemia is one of Deutsche Bank\u2019s UK Charities of the Year. This is a two year partnership with two small charities that have been nominated and voted for by UK employees. The programme has raised more than 20 million pounds since being established in 1999 and also links charities with other parts of the bank, for example HR, Finance, Public Affairs and Marketing, to lend wider expertise",
